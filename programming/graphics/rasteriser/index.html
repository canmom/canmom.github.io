title: Building my own rasteriser
description: In 2017 I built a rasterisation-based software renderer, loosely following Scratchapixel's article and the steps in the OpenGL rendering pipeline, in order to learn how the rasterisation algorithm works. This is a log of my reading and development of the program.
