description: It's 2002. Final Fantasy is at the height of its popularity. What's the next step? Unquestionably, a crossover with every Disney movie. Thus, Square created Kingdom Hearts, and kicked off one of the most impenetatrably complex game narratives out there. In mid-2017, inspired by a video of the intros, I set out to play it for the first time.
