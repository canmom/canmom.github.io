title: "NieR: Automata"
description: In a distant future, androids fight alien machine lifeforms in a futile proxy war over the fate (or legacy?) of an absent humanity. Like previous games by infamous troll Yoko Tano, it's a beautiful game of tragedy and existential themes, one which constantly reframes itself and revises your initial impressions. It made me cry, and maybe I can get you to cry too.
