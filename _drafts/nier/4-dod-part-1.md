Where we left off, we'd reviewed the story of <cite>Drag-on Dragoon 3</cite>. Next up is the game that launched the series, <cite>Drag-on Dragoon</cite> or <cite>Drakengard</cite> for the PS2. But there are a few interstitial parts that bridge the timeline between DoD3 and DoD1.

At the end of DoD3, we have five timelines established. In each one, Zero's five sisters are dead, but...

Branch A
: Mikhail is dead, and Zero is killed by One's brother, who plans to found a new religion worshipping the Intoners and the Angels they summon.

Branch B
: Zero creates Pacts in order to save Mikhail from dying, implanting the Flower in Mikhail's eye and in the process, turning herself into a child.

Branch C
: Zero survives but Mikhail is dead, and she does not know where she will find a dragon capable of killing her. Presumably, the world is destroyed.

Branch D
: Zero and Mikhail both survive, thanks to Accord's intervention, long enough for the Flower to bloom from Zero. Mikhail successfully destroys it. A number of new Accords appear. It's not known what happens to One's brother, but Mikhail lives for a long time yet, bearing witness to most of the world's human population killing each other by nuclear war.

Branch E (<cite>Story Side</cite> novel)
: Zero creates Pacts, as in Branch B, only to be killed by One's brother shortly afterwards. As in Branch A, One's brother takes on the identity of One, and founds a new Church of the Angels.

The subsequent media follows either Branch A (the manga <cite>Shi Ni Itaru Aka</cite> and the book <cite>Drag-on Dragoon version 1.3</cite>) or Branch E (all the other novellas, games, plays, etc.). The two branches mostly evolve in similar ways, but the absence of Pacts in branch A leads to some differences.

## A note on content

To contextualise <cite>Drag-on Dragoon</cite>, I think this video from Yoko Taro, released in the run-up to DoD3, is of interest.



As he explains, at the time of making DoD, he believed that only an 'insane' person could commit the kind of extreme scale of killing seen in a typical computer game, and thus in Drag-on Dragoon the overall theme is that everyone, protagonists included, is some degree of depraved and violent, barely distinguishable from the Empire. He later got a much more nuanced and interesting view of violence, and started to write much more humanising portrayals (<cite>Nier</cite>'s Masayoshi Yuri/Tyrann excepted), but DoD basically seems to throw all the worst things Yoko Taro could think of into its grimdark mix, its characters for the most part being various flavours of 'anime psycho'. When it works (mostly in the supernatural horror elements and the music and so on), DoD has an unsettling atmosphere matched in few games; when it doesn't work, it's just eyerolly 'did you really have to go there' edginess without a lot to say. (You can really see the <cite>Berserk</cite> influence.)

**Specific content warnings:** pedophilia (anything to do with Leonard), incest (anything to do with Furiae), cannibalism and child murder (anything to do with Arioch), rape (numerous times in <cite>Shi ni Itaru Aka</cite>). I will repeat these warnings when we get to relevant sections, but please feel free to skip forward to the articles on <cite>NieR</cite>.

## The Church of the Angels and the Seeds of Resurrection

A brief word about the Church of the Angels (天使の教会 <i>Tenshi no Kyoukai</i>), or as the original localisation of Drag-on Dragoon would have it, Cult of the Watchers. The icon of the Church is a pair of faces which overlap, creating the appearance of one face with two noses and three eyes. This can be taken to represent One and her clone brother, who are separate yet overlapping people...

We learn relatively little about the Church's theology, but there is one recurring passage which appears to be highly important. In the DoD localisation, this is rendered:

> Speak not the Watchers,
> Draw not the Watchers,
> Write not the Watchers,
> Sculpt not the Watchers,
> Sing not the Watchers,
> Call not the Watchers' name.

'Watchers' in DoD1's localisation and 'Angels' summoned by the Intoners in DoD3's localisation are both translations of [天使 <i>tenshi</i>](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%A4%A9%E4%BD%BF), and refer to the same beings. What these beings <i>are</i>, well, we still don't fully know!

Shortly after its founding, the Church created something known as the Seal ([封印 <i>fuuin</i>](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%B0%81%E5%8D%B0)) System, anchored in physical locations at the same Shrines occupied by the Intoner sisters, and in a person known as the Goddess of the Seal. According to the guide book, the purpose of the Seal System is to 'anchor' time, space and dimensions, encapsulated by the term 'Great Time' ([おおいなる時間 <i>ooinaru jikan</i>](https://jisho.org/search/%E3%81%8A%E3%81%8A%E3%81%84%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E6%99%82%E9%96%93)). In practice, this means the Seals prevent the manifestation of large, egg-like objects known as the Seeds of Resurrection ([再生の卵 <i>tenshi no tamago</i>](https://jisho.org/search/%E5%86%8D%E7%94%9F%E3%81%AE%E5%8D%B5), literally 'eggs of resurrection') or Seeds of Destruction. At some point, a faction develops within the Church who take the opposite view: they want to release the Seeds.

The <a href='http://rikoren.dreamwidth.org/95705.html#cutid1'>description</a> of the Seeds suggests that they have existed in the world a long time, but this is hardly consistent with the rest of the timeline and may have been retconned. Regardless of their history, the Seeds are enticing to humans and magical creatures alike. There is a legendary description which suggests the Seeds cause some kind of ascension to a new form. In truth, the Seeds are apparently an instrument of the God(s), intended to dispose of humanity.

## <cite>World Inside</cite> timeline: One's brother has kids

The <cite>World Inside</cite> book came packaged with the 10th Anniversary release of DoD. It contains some novellas and also some summarised backstory, including the first part of [the big timeline](http://nier2.com/timeline.html).

The hundred-year period between DoD and DoD3 is characterised mostly by disasters. From 1012 AD onwards, the Church of the Angels appoints a succession of Goddesses of the Seal, after each one is in turn assassinated (with the exceptions of the fifth (suicide) and sixth (kidnapped)). Their role is to somehow support the Seal System, which theoretically stops the world from descending into chaos (more than it already has!). Opposed to the Goddess is a 'separatist' faction, which stages a series of attacks and assassinations.

The 'Red Eye' disease first manifests inside the church in 1021 AD. Its symptoms are a loss of speech control and a berserk rage, and the person becomes stronger than they would be otherwise. Not long before, there was a civil war in the Church, in which One's brother is ousted as 'Suzerain' of the church, which seems to be the de facto leader. (I have not been able to confirm what the Japanese term is, but this title is used by multiple translators. It's a bit of an odd choice of religious title---the main meaning of Suzerain is a state which exerts power over a vassal or tributary state, but can also refer to a feudal lord with vassals.)

One's brother meets a refugee called Rosa in 1024 AD, and with her has twin children called Gruen and Grenat in 1025 AD. In 1041 AD, Gruen becomes Suzerain of the Church (at which point he would be age 16). In 1051 AD, One's bro first encounters the Red Eye disease, and witnesses Gruen manipulating the infected. He kills Gruen, but spares Gruen's son Verde; later, however, at some point later he changes his mind and becomes convinced he must destroy his bloodline in the Church. He comes back to kill Verde too in 1075 AD, but does not find the bearer of Verde's two children, Fey and Louis. He is also apparently unaware of the other line of descent through Grenat, a line which eventually leads to the children Seere and Manah.

Meanwhile, a kingdom called Caerleon is founded in 1025 AD, which the wiki places 'somewhere between Poland, Hungary and Slovakia'. There's a succession of kings who are, by and large, assassinated. This subplot doesn't seem to be all that important, since none of these kings get names, but eventually this will be where the main characters of DoD are born.

## Novella: the <cite>The Song of a Fourteen Year-Old</cite>/<cite>The Song of Fourteen Years</cite>

Much as with DoD3, the characters in DoD are expanded on in various novellas. These are collected in various places: the <cite>World Inside</cite> book and the <cite>Official Guide Book Complete Edition</cite>. To my knowledge, none get an official translation. Luckily, fan translators are on the job.

This novella takes place in 1093 AD, and has [a translation by kho-dazat](https://drakengard.fandom.com/wiki/Drakengard/Novella). It takes the point of view of Inuart, who is Caim's childhood friend, four years his junior. His father, Ipris, is a vassal and close friend of Caim's father Gaap. Inuart is besotted with Caim's sister Furiae, and at the outset of the story, learns they're set to be married. He's got big old issues with masculinity, and is deeply jealous of Caim, so he drinks a 'growth potion' sold by a shady merchant.

Ipris intervenes, and gives Inuart some Fatherly Advice: to get girl, play harp, and stop trying to out-sword Caim. Inuart turns out to be really good at the harp (despite his lyrics being, well, what you might expect from a 14-year-old), and he shares a brief moment of sexual tension with Furiae. The story ends with him improving his swordplay and hopeful for the future.

## <cite>Shi Ni Itaru Aka</cite>

The manga <cite>Shi Ni Itaru Aka</cite> is another one by Eishima Jun, featuring art by Yoo Jetae aka ZET. The title has been translated as 'The Red Unto Death' and 'Fatal Crimson'. You can find information on scanlations <a href='https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=94223'>at mangaupdates</a>. At time of writing, scans (a mix of Kiss/Supreme Cream scans, and Rekka's) are available <a href='https://mangakakalot.com/read-ma7qb158524492505'>here</a>, or Rekka's scans on archive.org <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627122136/http://drakengard-3.com/gallery/index.php?cat=14">here</a>. **Content warnings: explicitly portrayed rape in a lot of chapters, incest discussed in chapters 4 and 6 to 11, child sexual abuse attempted in chapter 13, extensive violence and gore throughout**. 

The manga for the most part follows One's brother, now simply going by One, and his travelling companion, an elf named Nero who fights with crossbows. Nero is an utterly unpleasant person, concerned more or less exclusively with doing violence and sex, and more than happy to rape people. One's brother is no longer the leader of the Church, but now seeks redemption, blaming it for the emergence of 'Red Eye' disease. 'Red Eye' causes its sufferers to go berserk and become much stronger, generally mostly losing the power of speech and attacking whoever's in sight.

One's brother has a version of the 'power of song' used by the Intoners. Whenever he sings, however, a black dragon shows up, its intentions unclear. One is hostile to the dragon, but only Nero appears to be able to drive the dragon away with his crossbows. The black dragon is not named in the manga, but is named elsewhere as Legna.

### Chapter 4-11: don't go to Caerleon, it's a horrible place

<cite>Shi Ni Itaru Aka</cite> takes place in three sections: a scene-setting opening in 1096 AD, a flashback set in the kingdom of Caerleon with the main characters of DoD in 1093 AD, and then a final sequence back in 1096 AD. I'm going to begin with the middle one.

**CW incest and rape in this section!** We're introduced to a princess, Furiae, and her made, Shirley. Both of them are obsessively attracted to Furiae's brother Caim, who is oblivious and concerned mostly with swordplay. An attack by a Red Eye sufferer is interrupted by One's brother, but he is injured by poison and passes out. So One's brother and Nero spend a week in the castle. Nero attempts to rape Furiae, though One intervenes, and then Shirley. He locks Shirley in a barn somewhere until Shirley comes down with Red Eye.

Before long, just about everyone in the castle has Red Eye. To kill the Red Eye sufferers, One's brother uses his 'power of song', which causes the black dragon to arrive, killing Caim's parents. Though the dragon leaves, Caim blames One's brother for the carnage (entirely correctly, it t, and he and Nero maek a hasty exit.

At the end, we see Accord writing in a book: Inuart should be present during these events, and his absence merits further attention. Presumably, then, something more or less similar happened in the E timeline, but with Inuart present.

### Chapter 1-4: we, who are about to die, recite our backstory

Three years later, we see One's brother and Nero attacking the Cathedral City. The church is led by One's great-granddaugter Fey, the current Suzerain. On their way in, they briefly have to repel the black dragon Legna.

One's brother is here to finish off the last of his bloodline in the Church of the Angels. The two surviving members are Fey and Chloe. Fey gives a bit of her backstory, hinting that she's had to bear the child of her brother Louis (or possibly Luis) before Louis died to a dragon in 1093 AD. After dealing with her various minions, One's brother kills both her and her child Chloe. (These events also take place at the same time in the E timeline.)

### Chapter 12-21: tl;dr it's One's brother's fault

The final section of the manga happens in an unknown feudal territory. One's brother and Nero witness group of Red Eye infected soldiers interrupt an execution of some 'heretics'. Meanwhile, someone who appears just like the Intoner One attacks a castle full of the kind of decadent pedophile nobles you meet in the pages of Berserk, and does a proper February 1917 on them.

One's brother reaches the castle, and cries to meet his supposedly dead sister. 'One' claims that the Red Eyes are actually potentially peaceful, only responding with violence when threatened, and that they're going to restore justice to the world.

But of course, this is a lie. 'One' turns out to be Nero's sister, using elf-y illusion and mind control powers which seem to work even on the Black Dragon. When Nero breaks the illusion, they have a big old fight, which Nero's sister wins, subduing both Nero and One's brother fairly easily. Her motivation is apparently just to cause as much death and destruction as possible, which she starts masturbating about in the middle of the room.

The Black Dragon, however, takes this opportunity to speak: it eats Nero's sister and explains that One's brother has, all along, been the source of the Red Eye disease. One's brother begs Nero to kill him; Nero obliges in chopping his head off, but then wanders around using the head a talisman as the Red Eye disease causes the world to descend into chaos. He's having the time of his life.

## <cite>Complete Guide</cite> novellas

The other novellas are printed in the <cite>Official Guide Book Complete Edition</cite>. They are translated [here](http://rikoren.dreamwidth.org/17443.html#cutid3) by DeviantArt user Kestrel, and reproduced on the wiki. [Caim](https://drakengard.fandom.com/wiki/Caim/Novella)'s, [Inuart](https://drakengard.fandom.com/wiki/Inuart/Novella)'s and [Furiae](https://drakengard.fandom.com/wiki/Furiae/Novella)'s 'novellas' are just a few paragraphs long, offering only a brief snapshot of the characters' lives.

There's some ambiguity here: at some point, the Church of the Angels splits into a Red Eye infected faction, which commands an Empire bent on destruction of everything and wishes to break the Seals, and a faction which maintains the Seal System, which is led by Hierarch Verdelet.

As in <cite>Shi Ni Itaru Aka</cite>, the black dragon attacked Caerleon's castle, and killed Caim and Furiae's parents. In the novellas, there's no mention of a Red Eye outbreak, or One's brother being present, so it's possible the black dragon showed up alone.

After their deaths, Ipris took over as regent, but died of illness a year later. The three kids, thoroughly traumatised, become pretty much their worst selves. Caim has become obsessed with nothing but revenge, Furiae all the more possessive of him, and Inuart finds himself shut out and ever more resentful.

At some point after this, Caerleon is lost to the empire. The three kids are moved out of the country---but before long the 'mark' of the Goddess of the Seal appears on Furiae, painfully, indicating the death of the previous Goddess, Asherah. Furiae is thus consigned to become the Goddess of the Seal, squashing her own desires. To the Hierarch Verdelet, who manages the Seal System, Furiae comes across as a cold and distant Goddess.

## The Union and the Empire, and Pacts

I can't seem to find clear information about when the Church of the Angels definitively splits into a hardline cult faction, and Verdelet's faction which manages the Goddess of the Seal. However, events seem to develop very quickly between 1096 AD (the events of <cite>Shi Ni Itaru Aka</cite>, and their parallel events in the E timeline) and 1099 AD (the events of DoD). The Church forms an Empire, and their armies---universally infected with Red Eye---go about ransacking places, without any attempt towards diplomacy. The remaining nations, Caerleon among them, band together in a Union which opposes the Empire. Verdelet, the 'Hierarch' of his side of the Church, is the leader of the Union.

This state of affairs is described in the [Official Guide](http://rikoren.dreamwidth.org/99171.html#cutid1), though the details seem a little hard to reconcile with the timeline so far and it may be outdated.

Verdelet is a partner in a pact, in this case with a dragon. Pacts involve a human and a magical creature. The human gives up something---examples include their voice, hair, womb, or capacity to age beyond childhood---and the pair gain a lot of power, but if one dies, so does the other. Verdelet gave up his hair, a pretty cheap price as they go; his dragon, however, has somehow become 'petrified'. Apparently Yoko Taro noted that Verdelet's dragon is an 'ancient dragon', a more powerful kind of dragon which other dragons fear to oppose. *How* it became petrified is not attested.

## Your deeply, deeply fucked up party

As noted above, the theme of DoD is insanity, as Yoko Taro understood it in 2003. This is less a kind of like, understanding by-and-for depiction of neurodivergence as much as a rather cartoonish presentation of various kinds of cruelty and depravity, especially in the case of Arioch.

### Manah and Seere

Manah and Seere's brief lives are mostly covered in the events of DoD, but before the game starts, they are both being raised by an abusive mother. She plays favourites, doting on Seere while treating Manah like a non-person, and eventually abandoned her in a valley where she was picked up by the Church of the Angels. By the time of DoD, she's only six years old, but some sort of other being speaks through her with a deep voice, and in [her novella](http://rikoren.dreamwidth.org/95841.html#cutid1), we hear her preaching about the Angels.

The mother, meanwhile, is killed by soldiers of the Empire, leaving Seere alone to form a pact with a Golem at the cost of his capacity to age beyond childhood. (This Golem seems much stronger than the many destroyed by Zero over the course of DoD3, and unlike those Golems has the ability to speak.) In [Seere's novella](http://rikoren.dreamwidth.org/92684.html#cutid1), Golem discovers the smell of Manah.

### Leonard

**Content warning: child sexual abuse**

Leonard is a hermit who lives in the woods with several young brothers. [His novella](http://rikoren.dreamwidth.org/94563.html#cutid1), and lines of dialogue which were cut from the localisation, describe how unknown to anyone else, he is sexually attracted to these brothers. He is at least guilty enough not to act on this attraction, but instead goes into the woods to wank in secret. This is the reason that, when we first meet him in <cite>Drag-on Dragoon</cite>, he was away from his brothers when the Empire showed up and killed them all. He is so guilty that he is easily manipulated into forming a pact by a fairy who shows up at the site. Like most fairies, this fairy has one mode: verbally abusive.

### Arioch

Arioch's [novella](http://rikoren.dreamwidth.org/91656.html#cutid1) describes how she was an elf housewife, but the Empire killed her husband and son. This traumatised her so much that she started making a habit of killing and eating people, especially children. This is about the extent of her characterisation. She is imprisoned by the Empire pending execution, but freed by an attack by the Alliance army, whereupon she got a chance to form a pact with a pair of 'elementals'

## The opening of <cite>Drag-on Dragoon</cite>

At the start of <cite>Drag-on Dragoon</cite>, it is 999 AD and the Empire largely seems to be winning the war. We meet Caim outside the grounds of a castle under siege, where he kills a whole lot of Imperial soldiers, but in the process takes a mortal injury. As he fights his way into the keep, he receives word that the Empire have captured a dragon.

Caim finds the red dragon, who we later learn is called Angelus or Angel (rendered as a katakana transliteration アンヘル, not to be confused with the Angels worshipped by the Church, who are referred to by the kanji 天使 <i>tenshi</i>). She is pinned down by chains in the castle courtyard, surrounded by a magic circle of unknown purpose. He raises his sword, threatening to kill her (though she is already dying), and demands to form a pact despite her evident contempt. She agrees, and the pair make, in the words of the translation, 'the fateful decision to live'.

Caim reaches his hand into his chest, and pulls out a glowing orb with a yolk; Angelus barfs up a similar orb. The orbs unite, and the pact is sealed. The price, however, is Caim's voice. From this point on, he can only speak through his sword.

Supported by Angelus, Caim is able to show the Imperial army what happens when you have air supremacy and infinite fireball ammo. The Empire has air support in the form of airships and gargoyle cubes, but they do not last very long. Angelus, for her part, is content to spout aphorisms about the futility of war, and question whether Caim really needs to blow up quite so many hundreds of enemy soldiers.

With Angelus's support, the castle is reclaimed, and Caim reunited with Furiae and Inuart.
