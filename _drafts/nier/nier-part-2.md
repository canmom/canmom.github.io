It's time to begin on <cite>NieR</cite> proper.

## A quick recap

{% capture recap %}
The year is 3361, and the last survivors of humanity have had their souls removed from their bodies, living now as disembodied 'gestalts', all to escape a deadly magic disease called White Chlorination Syndrome.

The souls are kept stable by means of a special 'stable' form of the magic particle, maso ([魔素](https://jisho.org/search/%E9%AD%94%E7%B4%A0)), provided by the 'Original', a boy (<cite>RepliCant</cite>) or man (<cite>Gestalt</cite>) named Nier. Nier's daughter Yonah also became a gestalt, but she is on the verge of 'relapsing' and becoming a mindless Shade, so she's being kept in a state of suspended animation. To keep him in line, Nier has been given a promise by the authorities running the Gestalt project: after 1000 years have passed, Yonah will be revived. But this is a lie, and there is no known means to save Yonah.

Created from Nier, Yonah and the other Gestalts are 'Replicants', soulless human vessels. Unexpectedly, over the 1300 year gap, these vessels have gained sapience and self-awareness, and now form their own communities. The plan had been to restore the Gestalts to their corresponding Replicants when the world was safe, but the Replicants are resisting having their consciousness overwritten, viewing the Gestalts as monsters. This is not helped by the fact that many Gestalts have begun relapsing and attacking Replicants, despite the stablising . Worse, the Original has seen through the game, and is going rogue, seeking to restore Yonah to her Replicant himself.

Devola and Popola, two androids who play a role in running the Gestalt/Replicant system, have a plan: they will use the combined power of the Grimoires Noir and Weiss to instantly restore all Gestalts to their Replicants at once. These Grimoires are human souls bound into books, but Grimoire Weiss is incomplete, and before the plan can be put into effect, Weiss needs a series of 'Sealed Verses'.

So Devola and Popola arrange for replicant!Nier to come into contact with Grimoire Weiss, and tell him that if he completes Grimoire Weiss, he may be able to save replicant!Yonah from her mysterious 'black scrawl' affliction (in truth, an uncurable result of the state of her gestalt). Weiss is proud and sarcastic, but quickly forms a bond with Nier, and together they go out into the world, killing Shades to protect the Replicants while looking for the Sealed verses...

## A few words about the game

NieR went through a variety of forms over the course of its development, including a turn-based JRPG, but eventually settled on an action-RPG inspired mainly by <cite>God of War</cite>. Compared to cavia's preceding two <cite>Drag-on Dragoon</cite> games, the combat is a bit more complex insofar as each weapon type has more than one moveset, although in the end you will probably end up spamming the stinger a lot. You have a dodge roll with iframes, and most enemies telegraph their attacks pretty well so you can get decent at dodging.

You also have quite flashy spells, broadly on the theme of summoning dark spears and blades made out of Celestial Alphabet. Moreover, you can fire a constant stream of magic bullets from Grimoire Weiss, which is helpful for crowd control, chip damage and stopping enemy projectiles. The game at times resembles a shmup as much as an action game.

Unlike the DoD  games, which presented the game in chapters on different maps with objectives to complete, <cite>NieR</cite> takes place in an open world, where you wonder around the different plot locations, free to take a break for sidequests or even fishing or gardening. The game experiments enthusiastically with genres: in one area you might be exploring a fixed-camera, greyscale mansion inspired by <cite>Resident Evil</cite>, another might have you navigating branching prose and solving reading comprehension puzzles, a boss might turn into something resembling a 3D bullet hell shooter...

There is a fairly rudimentary upgrade system, consisting of attaching magical 'words' to your weapons, and a variety of weapons to collect and upgrade. The weapon stories are unfortunately relegated to <cite>Grimoire NieR</cite>.

Unlike DoD, the plot does not really branch until near the end---but after you get the first 'ending', you get to witness the same events in a very different light. The game resumes about halfway through the plot; first, you receive Kainé's backstory (one of the best moments in the game to me), and from then on you can hear the voices of the Shades (thanks to Tyrann). This reframes many of your previous actions, and nets you 'ending' B. For the final pair of endings, you must collect all the weapons, and play through this segment again, and here you do get a choice... one we'll discuss later, since it's a heavy one.

The game's English dub is actually extremely good, especially Liam O'Brien's performance as Grimoire Weiss and Laura Bailey's as Kainé. (It's sometimes alleged that certain elements of the game, like Kainé's intersex status, were censored in the localisation, but I've been advised by Rekka that this basically isn't true and there are very few differences between the English and Japanese, or between <cite>Gestalt</cite> and <cite>Replicant</cite>. Rather, Kainé's intersex status and brother Nier's history doing sex work are only discussed in <cite>Grimoire NieR</cite>.)

Unlike the DoD games, <cite>NieR</cite> is not fully voiced: voice acting is mostly reserved for cutscenes on the main story, and certain conversations while wandering about the map. The sprawling array of sidequests are encountered mostly as text; alongside them you have optional minigames around fishing and gardening (which is based on real world time, and can be cheated using the system clock). Most of the sidequests are pretty banal, though a few have moments of poignance.

A 'version up' ('somewhere between a remaster and a remake') of <cite>RepliCant</cite> developed by Toylogic has recently been announced, titled <cite>Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139...</cite> (the square root of 1.5). As yet, very little is known about it beyond the involvement of Taura Takahisa of PlatinumGames (along with the usual gang---Yoko Taro, Okabe Keiichi and Saito Yosuke). At the time of writing, all we know is that the new version will be fully voiced, it will feature new Okabe Keiichi music, and some of the Japanese voice actors from <cite>Automata</cite> will return in unknown roles. There will also be some plot changes including an unknown new character. Beyond that, who knows? Once it comes out, I'll update this article.

## Meeting Kainé, the best character

Determined to stop at nothing to save Yonah, [replicant ]Nier sets out to acquire the Sealed Verses. Popola directs him to first travel to the Aerie, a village built on a series of rickety platforms above a gigantic chasm. The people of the Aerie are sealed in their houses when Nier arrives, and strangely hostile to visitors. A number of Shades manifest in the middle of the village, but Nier and Weiss make short work of them.

On the way back, he passes the shell of a caravan, with an awning outside of it---Kainé's home. Inside, he spots a necklance of Lunar Tears. Kainé interrupts his musing, telling him to keep his hands off the flowers---and Nier perceives the signs of magic around the arm possessed by Tyrann, and starts suspecting she's a Shade. So they end up fighting.

Kainé, it soon emerges, has pretty strong magic of her own. Nier seems to be getting the upper hand, but their battle is interrupted by the appearance of the big multi-Gestalt shade Hook. Kainé stops worrying about Nier, and both go after Hook. Ultimately, moments after saving Nier from a hefty blow, Kainé hits Hook with a hefty magic bullet and passes out. Fortunately, this is enough of a pummelling for Hook to retreat.

Weiss discerns that Kainé is possessed by a Shade, but nevertheless at least half-human, and this is enough to mollify Nier. He tends to her wounds, and when she wakes up the two part ways on *relatively* amicable terms. Weiss ruminates that Hook most likely contains a sealed verse, but Nier can tell he's not yet strong enough to beat it.

## Seafront: surprisingly okay, all things considered

Yonah's condition is getting worse, so Popola directs Nier to buy medicine in Seafront, which is pretty much what you'd expect from the name: a quiet, pseudo-mediterranean fishing town, with the ruins of a broken railway bridge just off the coast. Seafront is home to a post office which is surprisingly reliable, given the world is overrun by monsters!This was a bit of a stumbling block 

There, you can begin one of the game's more substantial sidequest chains, featuring the old lighthouse keeper. Although she's introduced as someone most people regard as a demanding jerk, it turns out that most of the townsfolk are engaged in an elaborate conspiracy to write letters in the role of her dead lover, and have been for years prior to the game.

Seafront is also where the game introduces its somewhat infamous fishing minigame. This was a bit of a stumbling block at the time of the game's release, since some players didn't realise that you have to walk to a different part of the map in order to catch the one fish needed to progress the plot. Nier can optionally do a whole series of joke quests to become better at fishing, spending progressively longer out at sea each time with the old fisherman who teaches him.

While there, Nier receives a letter to Popola from Seafront's mayor, warning that contact is being lost with the Aerie coinciding with a lot more Shades appearing. But first, Nier could do with a better weapon... First, however, there's a chance to drop by the bar and find a slightly drunk Devola. This sets up another sidequest, where you can later get both sisters to sing the <cite>Song of the Ancients</cite> together.

## The Junk Heap (too many robots)

As we read in <cite>The Magic Mountain</cite>, the Junk Heap is the site of an old military base built by the Japanese government during the war with the Legion. There, robots are manufactured, and apparently the factory can operate pretty well without any humans left to run it.

Nier and Weiss arrive just in time to save Jakob and Gideon from starvation. Abandoned by their mother a week prior, they have no materials to forge weapons to sell at the Junk Heap shop. Jakob asks Nier to go into the junk heap and gather the necessary bits.

The Junk Heap itself is a series of more or less identical rooms containing a whole lot of identical robots. Nier returns with the alloys the kids need after fighting some P-33 humanoid robots, but Jakob asks him to go back in, deeper into the Heap, in the hopes of finding their mother Blue. This time, Nier finds himself fighting a gigantic robot in an enormous round chamber, which is named as Geppetto (Pinocchio's creator) in <cite>Grimoire NieR</cite>. After destroying this robot, Nier finds the body of Blue and the lover she was attempting to elope with.

Nier returns, and the player can decide whether to tell the children the truth of what happened. Gideon, the younger brother, takes it especially badly.

## The return to the Aerie

Now better armed, Nier heads back to the Aerie. Outside, he meets Kainé fighting off a group of Shades. She tells him that they have overrun the village, and together they storm in, killing every Shade they see.

Before long, Hook arrives on the scene, now scarred by Kainé's earlier attack. The pair engage, and smack Hook around, inflicting some collateral damage. The villagers, hiding in their houses, are viciously hostile to Kainé, shouting out accusations that she's the one who brought the Shades.

Over the course of the fight, Nier and Kainé start to establish a rapport, working together to corner Hook. Finally, Hook roars, and attempts to imitate Kainé's grandmother's voice. In her voice, Hook attempts to persuade Kainé to give up and die. Kainé is absolutely incensed, 

> You're going to stop talking now. And then I'm going to walk over to you, and very carefully, extend my hand, reach into your chest, and <em>pull out your fucking heart!</em>
>
> My grandmother would never say that! She'd never tell me to give up on life! Never! I've spent my entire life searching for a way to avenge her death! She gave me the strength to deal with this goddamn mutant body!
>
> Do you know how long I've been like this!? How much I loathe myself?

Kainé and Nier make good on the threat. Ultimately, Nier smashes Hook right through the platform they're fighting on, impaling it on the pillar underneath. Kainé lies down, her revenge complete, but Nier resolves to save her, chastisting Weiss for suggesting that it would be more comfort to let her die.

With Nier's encouragement, Kainé opens her eyes. Between Weiss's prattle about what a true warrior would do, and Nier's sincere entreaty to join the group as a friend, she decides to get up and come along...

## To Façade!

Kainé mentions that she knows a guy who also has the Black Scrawl: the King of Façade. And his kingdom might just have found a cure. So the gang pack up for the desert area.

On the way across the desert, they're attacked by groups of wolves. A mysterious Shade wolf howls in the distance.

The player at this point does not have reason to see the wolves as anything other than enemies, but since this is a chronological presentation, let's summarise what's been happening in Façade. As the city has expanded, the humans of Façade have been killing the wolves; to the wolves, then, attacking the people is a matter of tit-for-tat revenge. Their leader is Roc, a dog who underwent the Gestalt process in lieu of its owner back when normal humans were still around! It's tried to live in peace with the people of Façade, but with no ability to communicate, the fight goes on...

As we read in <cite>A Little Princess</cite>, Façade is a city ruled by [thousands of strangely specific rules](https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Facade), governing everything from architecture to the right way to do a birthday party. They also uniquely speak a different language to the rest of the people of the Replicant world, presented in the voice acting as rearranged, ungrammatical Japanese syllables.

Kainé is welcome, thanks to having saved Fyra from a pack of wolves at some point in the past. However, she's still reluctant to go too far in, and waits by the entrance. Nier and Weiss wander around for a while, but they're barred entrance to the King's manor, and return to the gate---where they bump into Fyra.

Fyra, forbidden from speaking by the rules since she does not own land, instead communicates by a sign language which Weiss is able to follow. As the rules dictate, Fyra insists on giving the group a tour of Façade, using the improbable quicksand river circling the central pit. This gives Weiss enough of a corpus to start interpreting the language.

As they regroup at the entrance, a group of Masked People suddenly interrupt. The Prince has gone missing in the 'Barren Temple'. Per Rule 83,348, they must immediately search for him. But per rule 50,527, only nobility can enter the temple! The contradiction can thankfully be resolved by sending outsiders, who are not bound by Façade's rules, and so Nier et al. are sent off to rescue the Prince.

### The Barren Temple

The Barren Temple consists of a series of puzzle rooms where you are subject to some kind of restriction (e.g. not jumping, standing still or using magic attacks). There are a large number of stone cubes which shoot out magic projectiles, recognisably the same Gargoyle Cubes as we saw in the DoD world. Where the people of Façade found the resources to build this elaborate temple complex and fill it with magic puzzles remains an open question!

Before long, they briefly encounter the Prince, who shouts at them to leave the temple. However, he soon gets grabbed by a magic cube (for standing still). A few rooms later, Kainé makes the mistake of breaking a no-magic rule, and also gets grabbed.

Eventually, Nier passes to the other end of the temple, and finds the Prince--- but he's surrounded by a swarm of Gargoyle Cubes which start flying in geometric patterns, including at one point a large humanoid. Kainé joins him, and together they dismantle the big cube... golem... thing... and the Prince crawls out of the pit. Apparently he came to obtain a wooden mask.

It turns out that the King they were looking for has died, and this mask is the key for the Prince ascending the throne and becoming King himself. In return for the timely rescue, the King offers Nier a favour---and lacking a personal favour to ask, he decides to request a Rule Zero be added, which allows the population to vote to change the other rules.

Nier finally gets a chance to ask about the Black Scrawl. As you'd expect from the King being dead, the efforts of Façade were in vain. Still, Nier promises to come back to visit some time later. (Much later, it will turn out.)

### The Junk Heap: round 2
