So, season 2 of _Adventure Time_.

Looking at the original air dates, the season boundary seems rather arbitrary at this point. The last episode of season 1 aired on September 27, 2010, and the first episode of season 2 on October 11, 2010. They only skipped a week!

I don't really know how to interpret TV ratings numbers, but according to the people who estimate such things, about 2 million people were watching _Adventure Time_ when it aired at this point, more or less the same as Season 1. The numbers appear to rise to a peak of about 3.5 million around season 5, and then steadily decline (perhaps as much because the internet happened as because people weren't watching the show anymore). Still, 2 milllion sounds like a pretty big number - no doubt the execs at Cartoon Network had realised they'd found some pretty sweet capital here.

The other thing I notice on this list is... this is the season where Rebecca Sugar's name appears among the list of writers and storyboarders. Apparently she began as a storyboard revisionist, then became a storyboard artist (before of course ultimately getting her own show in _Steven Universe_... am I gonna liveblog that? Oh god, the controversies...)

I'm going to try some more experimental things in this season's liveblog than just livecapping the episodes and my immediate reactions. We'll see how it goes.

## Season 2
### Episode 1: _It Came from the Nightosphere_

The season starts out with, it's gotta be said, a fucking brilliant episode. I think the showrunners thought so too, because Marceline's dad (later named Hunson Aberdeer) becomes a recurring character.

I really like how they play off the tension of Finn and Marceline's completely different perceptions and approaches to the situation here, but also, especially, the _incredible_ imagery they used for Marceline's dad. _Adventure Time_ does really well with squishy goo monsters, transparent sacs, fronds etc. - their 'dragons' are unique as hell - and it's on full display here.

The 'why did you eat my fries?' thing is probably intended here to be a deliberately nonsensical, minor issue; later on they will try and retcon that as they flesh out the relationship between Marceline and her dad.

### Episode 2: _The Eyes_
A 'something weird happens and Finn and Jake respond' episode, but one that works really, really well. The horse, god... the bit with the blindfold! It's like the 'elephant joke sequence', constantly building on itself and iterating. We know the horse will always menace Finn and Jake, but the ever more roundabout ways it does so, and the episode's rhythm... what a good sequence, honestly.

The ending is, eh. Of course they would have to resolve the tension ('why the horse, will Finn and Jake ever get to sleep') somehow. 'It's the Ice King trying to understand friendship' works well enough, and the ending is actually quite cute.

### Episode 3: _Loyalty to the King_

What a strong start to the season the last two episodes were! "This is gonna be a great season! Can't wait to see where they go next!"

Where they go next is a disaster, honestly.

The Ice King shaves his beard. Having done so, he starts getting fawned over by dozens of princesses who want to get with the 'Nice King' despite his obviously callous, misogynist behaviour. Finn and Jake also swear to serve the 'Nice King' as knights for... some reason... but as Finn becomes increasingly uncomfortable with being expected to treat women as sex objects, and eventually works out that the 'Nice King' is the Ice King and reveals the ruse.

So, "don't treat women as objects, boys". Or something. Not an incorrect message, obviously. But where it falls down, just catastrophically, is that all the women in this episode are turned by the demands of plot into being just as disposable and vapid as the (N)Ice King believes them to be, and Finn and Jake are put in the role of rescuers - to the point of having to _fight their way through_ the foolish princesses in order to glue the Ice King's beard back on and reveal his true nature.

It's so bad! It's probably the worst episode of the show so far - not just mediocre and unfunny but misogynist at its core. In this episode, women lack autonomy and will quite literally gladly accept being thrown in jail to get with a 'pretty' jerk. Who the fuck wrote this? Kent Osborne, apparently, who also worked on the last episode, and in the last season, _My Two Favourite People_, and _When The Wedding Bells Thaw_. The latter two of which also focus on het gender relations, squarely from the perspective of men, with women reduced mostly to tools to further the plot. Lady Rainicorn, at least, doesn't suffer the same level of character assassination, but MTFP had that whole Tiffany gag...

All right, Kent! I'm _watching_ you. You're back up in Episode 10 this season, which has the unpromising title of "To Cut a Woman's Hair".

### Episode 4: _Blood Under the Skin_

This episode is also... not great. It does introduce a fan favourite character, Choose Goose. Anyway, the plot of this episode is: Finn gets bullied by some knights (uh, OK?) for not having sufficiently 'click-click' (make a clicking noise with your mouth lol) armour, so he goes on a quest to get some, which requires him to undergo various kinds of vaguely sexual humiliation, from seeing a bunch of old people naked by accident (really?) to being expected to pick up a ball with his buttocks (_really?_) to, uh... forced femme?

Give in to the forced femme, Finn... but honestly this episode was just uncomfortable.

### Episode 5: _Storytelling_

Jake gets ill so Finn has to tell him a story. It has to be a real story for reasons, so Finn goes off to build a story around a checklist. Naturally his vague-at-best understanding leads him to treat people in a really dickish way, but it all works out for the best and in the end, creates the story after all, just not as he imagined.

It's a cute conceit. The episode is... kinda average overall.

Notably, this introduces Mr. Fox, here just one of a lot of forest animals. Mr. Fox will become a much more prominent character!

There's something to say about how they code gender among the forest animals. In Adventure Time's super-stylised art style, it's mostly through voices, eyelashes, and minor feminising touches like a wavy colar or visible lips. Nearly every animal in the forest is in a hterosexual, nuclear family, grumble grumble...

Come to think of it, how is it that there are so few of each kind of animal that a name like 'Mr. Fox' or 'Mr. Goose' could be an unambiguous referent? Did the apocalyptic event that left Finn as the only human also wipe out all the foxes, geese etc. down to only one or two? There are exceptions to this naming scheme: instead of Ms. Goose, we have 'Boobafina'... the answer is of course, it's a cartoon for kids and I'm overthinking it.

### Episode 6: _Slow Love_

In this episode, we continue the focus on heterosexuality with Finn and Jake being called to help an incel 'snail'. (OK, they don't use the word 'incel', but the rhetorical similarity is uncanny). The guy is pushy, smashes up Finn and Jake's house, and overall seems to have no redeeming qualities, until the boys teach him to beatbox while swinging swords, at which point dozens of snail women flock to him and Jake has to result to injuring him with salt to get him to give the stolen piece of house back.

At this point, it's revealed he's actually a slug, not a snail - but fortunately one of the 'snail' women is also actually a slug, and they start making out in front of Finn and Jake's house, which the boys agree is gross.

So in short: another episode where women are mostly props and accessories, and male characters get to have internal lives and character development. It's wacky or something, I guess.

This episode has snails with boobs, lipstick and eyelashes. I think the absurdity is kind of the point, but _honestly_. At some point you need to stop making fun of a bad trend and show an alternative, you know.

### Episode 7: _Power Animal_

Finn gets kidnapped by gnomes who want to use him as a power source to invert the world, while Jake attempts to deal with his lack of focus and commitment. Ultimately this is what leads to him rescuing Finn.

This is the first episode to feature the 'Party God', a floating wolf head in a snapback. _Adventure Time_ is really obsessed with 'parties' at this stage in the narrative, though it doesn't do a whole lot to actually make them seem appealing.

There's not a huge amount to say about this episode. The Party God is at this point voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who has voiced animal characters in a whole bunch of cartoons, e.g. Appa, Momo and Lion? That's a thing. His main role in AT is Cinnamon Bun.

### Episode 8: _Crystals Have Power_

The cool thing about this episode is that we get Tree Trunks back.

This is the first episode focused on Jake's dysfunctional relationship with his family! We've seen Jake's parents a couple of times, e.g. in _Memories of Boom Boom Mountain_, but this I think is the first time we get to see more about what Jake feels about them. 'Bad dads' seems to be a theme in this season (c.f. Marceline) and of the show in general (as we'll see when Finn's dad shows up, much much later).

In this case, Jake accidentally hurts Finn, and this reminds him of his dad praising him for accidentally hurting his brother. There's uncomfortable shades of how abuse survivors fear they will re-enact abuse. Anyway, Jake's newfound pacifism (didn't we already have this plot in _His Hero_?) proves troublesome when Finn is kidnapped by crystal soldiers from another dimension, and Jake can't get them to give him back just by asking or vaguely threatening the guards without credibility.

The resolution is that Jake's dad was _actually_ saying Jake would hurt 'everybody who is evil'. This is lucky, because it turns out eating the crystal apple made Tree Trunks gain magic powers and become 'Quartzion, ruler of the crystal men', and, corrupted by their power, attempt to turn Finn into her 'sexy crystal king' (even though he's like what, 12 at this point?). It's like the Standard Ice King Plot but backwards. PG sexual violence is just what semi-villains do in _Adventure Time_, idek?

Anyway, with Jake's 'biz' resolved, he punches the apple out of Tree Trunks and they return home so that Tree Trunks can become a recurring character like the fans want.

### Episode 9: _The Other Tarts_

This episode's pretty good actually - notwithstanding entirely unnecessary disablism.

Princess Bubblegum tasks Finn and Jake with transporting a set of 'royal tarts' to the sacred 'annual backrubbing ceremony' - at risk of her own execution! Finn comes up with an elaborate ruse which backfires spectacularly, leaving him and Jake stranded in the desert sans tarts, while Cinnamon Bun takes a set of poisoned decoy buns along a safe 'royal tart path'. (This of course comes with mean-spirited jokes at the expense of the 'half-baked' Cinnamon Bun.)

I enjoyed all the jokes of Finn's elaborate justifications for doing the worst possible thing at every juncture. Anyway, in fact, PB is not at pain of execution; Finn and Jake were so incompetent they pulled some kind of mobius double reacharound and Cinnamon Bun had the real tarts all along; and the blind and 'mad' Royal Tart Toter arrives at the gathering and makes everyone uncomfortable by acting like random animals are tarts.

In terms of that Very Important Lore, a map in this episode gives us the first mention of the Fire Kingdom.

### Episode 10: _To Cut a Woman's Hair_

In this season it seems like every fun episode has to be balanced by an excruciating one.

In this one, Finn and Jake are menaced by an ugly (and as Jake suggests and is implicitly confirmed, therefore evil) Forest Witch, who demands that they acquire princess hair to cover her bald spot or she'll absorb Jake into her butt. Yeah, eesh. This is an angle to forcing Finn to start confronting his anxiety over romance; he eventually takes PB on a very awkward 'date' which we can read as her humouring him, I guess.

The resolution is that she rejects the bubblegum 'hair' that Finn got from PB (and _eats_ it!) so Finn says she'd be ugly even with hair, and she relents.

The number of female characters whose arcs don't revolve entirely around their relationship with a male character remains at, what, just Marceline?

This _is_ the first episode to reveal Finn's incredible flowing blonde locks, which he donates to the Forest Witch in lieu of princess hair - only to find she's still evil. I guess it grows back fast!

### Episode 11: _The Chamber of Frozen Blades_

In this episode, Finn and Jake are obsessed with ninjas for some reason. They found out the Ice King is too, and smash his house up with techniques of 'Friojitsu' described in a manual in his house. Meanwhile, the Ice King attempts to kidnap Doctor Princess - not actually a princess, her surname is just Princess! - and Gunter lays an egg which hatches into a cat!? This episode is something...

The kanji on the cover of the ice manual reads 氷忍者 - 氷 is the kanji for ice, and 忍者 is a compound meaning ninja. I'm guessing that this would read as a jukugo word, so 氷 would take the on'yomi reading ヒョウ (hyou); the compound would read ひょうにんじゃ (hyouninja), but if it's not read as a jukogo word it might take a kun'yomi reading and you'd get こおりにんじゃ (koorininja). I did a search for 氷忍者 and I found Japanese ice skating videos, so it does seem to be something Japanese people might actually say; tentatively there's more evidence for こおりにんじゃ. Someone more familiar with the language, let me know :)

As for 'friojitzu' - if 'frio' is supposed to be ふり (furi), there's various things it could be (though clearly it's just based on 'freeze'). The least implausible is 降り (rainfall/snowfall), but I'm guessing a native Japanese speaker wanting to come up with a name for an ice-based martial art wouldn't come up with a name that sounds like 'friojitzu' (in any case, 術 (じゅつ) would be better transliterated 'jutsu', and 'jitsu' is a different word altogether!).

This episode is of course more about modern ninja kitsch than the actual historical spies. I think _Planetes_ did a better job of parodying ninja nerds (especially, how western ninja nerds come across to the Japanese protagonists), and I'm sure there's plenty more better anime examples, but eh.

### Episode 12: _Her Parents_

Here we introduce Lady Rainicorn's parents, and get some backstory on dogs and rainicorns that will just... never come up again?

We knew already that the Rainicorns, for some reason, speak Korean. Here, in order to make an awkward social event, we find out that there was once a devastating war between rainicorns and dogs(!), so Jake decides to pretend to be a rainicorn to avoid alienating Lady's parents (helped by the fact that both have very limited vision). This involves increasing pain and humiliation for Finn, culminating in the parents attempting to eat him, at which point Jake finally gives up the ruse. Naturally, it's fine - a dog saved her dad in the war so they actually love dogs. Then they go and eat a soy substitute for human meat that, they claim, tastes just like the real thing. Apparently it's delicious!

Given that there's all sorts of nasty stereotypes about Asian people eating weird things, I feel kinda uncomfortable with the whole cannibalism subplot. Anyway, check out this quote from the _Adventure Time_ wiki:

> When Finn performs the traditional Rainicorn rain dance, Bob and Ethel get insulted. This may be because Finn is acting in a stereotypical manner, which could be offensive to them. 

Gee, you think? (Though the more obvious interpretation is that Finn is just making shit up.)

The 'soy human' bit was kind of funny, but most of the ~wacky~ stuff in this episode felt strained, 'trying too hard'. Lady's parents feel less like characters from whom the humour can come naturally, and more a bunch of 'wacky foreigner' jokes stapled together. Like, why name the traditional rainicorn game some mash of nonsense syllables and not just, something in Korean? I was kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop - that the parents were playing a prank on Finn or something - but no, apparently that's just what Rainicorns are like.

### Episode 13: _The Pods_

Stop me if you've heard this one before: Finn and Jake encounter some strange magic person. They get embroiled in wacky events. A village we've never seen before is threatened, but they contain the threat they accidentally released.

So Finn and Jake get some magic beans from a gnome knight, two good and one evil, which turn out to produce pods containing various things (pigs in costumes, magic wands, ice cream); the piglets turn out to be the evil ones, but they're weak to ice cream. None of these events are ever mentioned again.

### Episode 14: _The Silent King_

This episode is about Hobbes's _Leviathan_.

No, hear me out!

Finn and Jake oust an evil king from a goblin nation. The goblins ask Finn to be their king - and when he refuses, they start a riot, attacking each other, self-harming and other such things. So Finn steps in 'to save them from themselves'.

Compare Hobbes:

> *ostendo primo conditionem hominum extra societatem civilem, quam conditionem appellare liceat statum naturæ, aliam non esse quam bellum omnium contra omnes; atque in eo bello jus esse omnibus in omnia.*
>
> I demonstrate, in the first place, that the state of men without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all things.

or later

> Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called War; and such a war as is of every man against every man.

Jake says Finn should have a queen, and then volunteers. I know it's like, a man in a dress joke on some level, but I support this gay subtext becoming gay text.

We need a conflict, so Finn soon discovers that his authority is not quite absolute: there is a long list of 'royal rules' that he must follow. While these royal rules are more about silly things like 'the king may not brush his own teeth' or 'the king may not cut his own food', this reflects an ancient debate about what, if anything, should constrain the power of the King - whether they have a [Divine Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings) to rule as they will, or if their mandate might be withdrawn if they fail to live up to their responsibilities. For Kings, of course, they want as much divine right as they can get away with. This theory became cemented by James VI of Scotland around 1597-98 about 50 years before Hobbes sought a secular justification for monarchy during the English Civil War.

In this case, every time Finn breaks a rule, the Goblins immediately offer themselves up for 'spanking', suggesting Finn is just as cruel as the prior king. Finn starts to realise the goblin society functions perfectly well with a pure figurehead King - in fact this becomes literal, as Finn finds that he can be replaced with a statue and leave the Goblin Kingdom behind.
