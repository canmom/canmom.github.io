<p>Last time, Eva actually seems to have solved the riddle of the gold! She had the help of the younger version of herself inside her head, who may or may not be a disguised witch. Unfortunately for us, the narration sees no need to share how she reached her solution.</p>

<p>She’s evidently left the guesthouse behind. Somehow, she’s found an underground spiral staircase.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-01.png">
</figure>

<p style="">Where is this staircase? We don’t know.</p>

<p>At the bottom, Eva finds a metal door, and the illustration resembles a mine. At the bottom is written “On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall find the home of the gold.”</p>

<p>Well, well, well!</p>

<p>Behind the door, she finds a <em>ridiculously</em> posh room.</p>

  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-02.png">
</figure>

<p>And, in the centre of the room… is the gold. Eva gets very excited, decides money can indeed buy happiness.</p>

</figure>

<p>So… does that mean Beatrice’s ritual is finished? That was abrupt. Or is there some loophole she can wriggle out of?</p>

<p>Eva laughs about how the rest of the relatives will be ruined and disappear, while George will restore the family’s honour. Charming.</p>

<p style="">Eva thanks young!Eva for her magic.</p>

</figure>

<p style="">Waiting for something terrible to happen. Like, there’s five episodes to go. This is clearly not the end of the games.</p>

<hr>

<p style="">Eva leaves the room, and encounters Rosa at the top of the stairs. I wonder how Rosa found it…</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-05.png">
</figure>

<p style="">So Rosa has also solved it?</p>

<p>Apparently the main hint from ‘sweetfish’ is to the ocean, and Rosa thought too much about it. Anyway, Rosa says she’s not interested in being head, and she’s happy for Eva to take it from Krauss, as long as she gets her agreed-on portion of the gold.</p>

<p>They both recognise what they each have to gain by shooting the other, and even level their guns. But they stand down.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-06.png">
</figure>

<p>What is <em>with</em> the Ushiromiyas?</p>

<p>They agree that murder wouldn’t be worth the risk (morally wrong? who cares about that apparently) and they trust each other the most of the siblings.</p>

<p>I note that right now, Eva and Rosa could qualify as <em>two who are close</em>. And we have <em>those who remain</em> in the guesthouse.</p>

<p>They discuss how to handle bringing up the gold so that Krauss can’t claim ownership since it was on the mansion. This turns into an argument: Eva wants to keep it secret, but Rosa wants to keep to the agreed protocols: announce the gold as soon as it’s found. Eva promises Rosa 150 million yen soon, but implicitly threatens to withdraw it if she blows the lid. The argument gets a bit heated.</p>

<p>Rosa also claims that, due to the locked-room mystery, Nanjo could only have been lying, as part of some scheme of Kinzo’s to encourage them to solve the riddle, and nobody is actually dead.</p>

<p>Eventually they agree: Rosa will keep the secret for one day, until the end of the family conference - <em>when the seagulls cry</em>. Eva promises Rosa she will split the gold fairly, and just needs time to think.</p>

<p>Young!Eva interrupts, petulantly demanding that Eva should keep <em>all</em> the gold.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-07.png">
</figure>

<p>They’re literally calling her ‘the witch’ in narration now.</p>

<p>And Beatrice decides to acknowledge this ‘witch’. They talk in the gold room.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-08.png">
</figure>

<p>If young!Eva was Bernkastel or Lambdadelta, it would be odd that she doesn’t recognise Beatrice. <em>Unless</em>… this is Lambdadelta before she became Lambdadelta???</p>

<p>Beatrice presents the head ring to young!Eva as proof that she’s the new head.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-09.png">
</figure>

<p>So Eva has <em>forked</em> into two people, one of whom is a disembodied witch child, the other an adult? Wild.</p>

<p>…and Beatrice goes further:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-10.png">
</figure>

<p>I feel like young!Eva is the last person we’d want to be an Endless Witch, honestly. Beatrice goes even further, also granting young!Eva her name.</p>

<p style="">How many Beatrices will there even be?</p>

<p style="">This leads to a coronation ceremony.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-11.png">
</figure>

<p>Beatrice sure likes to throw a big party.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-12.png">
</figure>

<p>Beatrice seems awfully calm about relinquishing all her status, especially given how hard she fought Virgilia to keep it. Something doesn’t add up.</p>

<p>Young!Eva takes on the new name of Eva Beatrice, and gets a new look.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-13.png">
</figure>

<p>I guess there’s just a fashion spell or something? We get a CGI of the ceremony, with the audience present.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-14.png">
</figure>

<p>Interestingly, Lambdadelta and Bernkastel are there in the background. Anyway, the portrait changes to one of Eva Beatrice.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-15.png">
</figure>

<p>Virgilia also offers her congratulations, along with mildly scolding Beatrice. Ronove reveals his service has transferred to Eva Beatrice, and mentions being one of the 72 demons ‘permitted to serve the Golden Witch’ - presumably the 72 Goetic demons?</p>

<p>The now ex-Beatrice tells Ronove to take care of her.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-16.png">
</figure>

<p>Apparently witches need references? There’s a witchy bureaucracy? Apparently Lambdadelta is a ‘witch of the Senate’, and now Eva Beatrice’s guardian. Though she immediately regrets it when she judges Eva Beatrice insufficiently grateful. Bernkastel scolds her for being irresponsible.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-17.png">
</figure>

<p>Apparently Lambdadelta also had an ‘unfortunate childhood’ with ‘unrewarded effort’. Yeah, like the unrewarded efforts of the workers exploited by the Ushiromiyas? *socialist grumbling*</p>

<p>Bernkastel, on the other hand, doesn’t hold back.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-18.png">
</figure>

<p style="">Bernkastel, it turns out, only came for the novelty and the drinks.</p>

<p>Beatrice offers Eva Beatrice the gift of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory as well, in order for Eva Beatrice to carry out her own resurrection ritual.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-19.png">
</figure>

<p>Oh. So this <em>isn’t</em> the end of murders on Rokkenjima? Oh no.</p>

<hr>

<p style="">Finally Battler interrupts.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-20.png">
</figure>

<p>Will it mean Eva Beatrice steps in as his opponent?</p>

<p style="">Virgilia appears. She reminds Battler not to necessarily trust what he’s seeing.</p>

<p>Battler asserts this ceremony must be fake. He asks about the nature of young!Eva. Eva says he wouldn’t believe her if she told him. Ronove says to think of her as a ‘visualisation of a different being inside Urishomiya Eva’.</p>

<p>Then, the newly-ex-Beatrice asks Battler to name her. Really? You trust this guy?</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="ALT TEXT NEEDED!" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/umineko/2017-08-02-lets-read-umineko-episode-3-part-12/img-21.gif">
</figure>

<p>Battler misses his chance, and just goes for “Beato”. She’s disappointed.</p>

<p>Virgilia says this distinction should be useful. Battler wonders what her game is. They both agree, at least, that Eva did a good job in solving the riddle, and clap for her, calling a truce of sorts.</p>
