Ange's coming back to Rokkenjima!

But first, responding to some reader comments:

> <b class="name">Reuel:</b> Congratulations on your ressurection. Glad to see the let’s read back. As someone who also took years long breaks from Umineko I’m curious do you think there is anything about Umineko that made you lose interest at these specific points?

Thanks, it's good to do this again.

I think for me it's basically less the VN itself and more just my ADHD attention pattern. I tend to live in a way where I really hyperfocus on something for a while... and then my obsessive interest burns out, or something else displaces it, and then that thing falls into the "I'll get around to it in a bit" pile, and then gradually slides out of medium-term memory unless something happens to remind me of it. Similar things happen to other projects all the time: for example, I have procrastinated more than a year on working on the sequel to [The Tale of the Little Witch](https://canmom.art/animation/little-witch-1).

Most of the time, it simply does not occur to me to do one of these 'backburner' things, since other things are filling my attention (this time it was mainly gamedev and the demoscene), and I plain don't realise how much time has passed because I'm just not thinking about it at all. If something can be done in one of those hyperfocus windows, I can do amazing things... if not, well, we're in trouble! It is like there is an 'energy barrier' to getting back into that state, so when I *do* think about it, I remember (for example) the effort it takes to edit all those damn screenshots, and so it has a sort of 'nah I don't feel like it right now' energy.

It takes a fair bit of effort to liveblog the longer chapters of <cite>Umineko</cite>, so the 'barrier to getting going' is quite high. This was even more true for the original five-year hiatus, because I had to reread the entire story to get back up to speed on what was going on. This time I remembered the story well enough to just settle in right where I left off.

But yeah, I think I tend to end up on hiatus after particularly big and involved chapters, just because it takes the most effort to write them up, so that makes my perception of 'how much energy it will take to pick up <cite>Umineko</cite>' more daunting. It's not even that I was not interested! At the end of chapter 13, I really wanted to know what would happen and where this was all going. Just, my perfectionism got in the way. So I had to compromise on that a bit: for example, I don't meticulously ruby-text romaji for every Japanese quote anymore. (It's probably easier to read for non-Japanese readers this way, anyway.)

(Ironically, I think *trying* to hack the OnScripter program to automate scaling, cropping and describing the screenshots, even though I failed, was actually quite useful for me. Because that got me into a 'thinking about Umineko' state, and that made the bridge to 'liveblog more of it' more viable. And it led me to think about other approaches which could make it easier without requiring a custom fork, like copypasting text from the script.)

> <b class="name">Zasis:</b> heyyy missed you!!!! so unexpected to see you, hehe, but i'm very glad! i'm very enjoying your umi blogging ♥️

Thanks, appreciate it a lot! I am really grateful for all the love shown to this liveblog by Umineko fans over the years, and for still coming back after all this time, you're the best. And yeah, strange twist of fate that I ended up back here. But hey, it's proving grounding, so let's keep at it.

Ange is on a boat, going to Rokkenjima! The chapter opens with a jazz piece in the soundtrack, which turns out to be diegetic music being played by Asakusa on the radio.
