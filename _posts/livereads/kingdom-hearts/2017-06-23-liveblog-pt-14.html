excerpt: in which Maleficent steals the show and itâ€™s not nearly the end
---
<p>At last: the Hollow Bastion, perhaps the origin of the Heartless? We have blown up many things to get to this point. Now itâ€™s time to blow up our good bro Riku. Probably.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora, Goofy and Donald stand at the base of a large series of floating rocky platforms, with a distant castle and text reading 'Hollow Bastion' in spiky, purple-outlined letters." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-00.png">
</figure>

<p>Iâ€™ve got to admit, given that I am already conflating â€˜Hollowâ€™ and â€˜Heartlessâ€™ in my head pretty often, this is not going to help. Anyway, sweet set, sweet music.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="The Beast, a big brown furry guy in a purple robe." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-01.png">
</figure>

<p>Also this guy is here. Does that mean weâ€™re not going to see a Beauty and the Beast level? I guess that makes sense.</p>

<p>The Beast is here to take Belle back. (I hope Belle wants to go back.) He has a go at Riku, but Riku does an acrobatic pirouette off the <strike>handle</strike> platform then justâ€¦ straight up fucking <em>murders</em> the Beast with his sword.</p>

<p>Sora intervenes and Riku takes ownership of my keyblade! The bounder! The cad! My OP superweapon!</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Riku throws me a wooden sword to be extra patronisingâ€¦ and Donald Duck and Goofy immediately abandon me to chase after the keyblade! Donald doesnâ€™t even hesitate. Wow. <em>Jerks</em>.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="An edit of the 'Friendship ended with Mudasir' meme, with Mudasir and Salman replaced with 'Donald and Goofy' and 'Beast' ('Now Beast is my best frined')" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-03.png">
</figure>

<p>So now we have a puzzle dungeon with Beast. Itâ€™s pretty fun.</p>

<p>We enter the castle and get a cutscene with a hall of sleeping Princesses. Maleficent does some wonderfully hammy acting to begin the Evil Ritual.</p>

<p>The Beast leaves to chase a Heartless version of Belle (I think) andâ€¦</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku, now in a purple, black and red outfit with incongruous blue hands. The outfit is lined as if it is muscled." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-04.png">
</figure>

<p>Hey itâ€™s this guy! He tells me the darkness will destroy me. Like, honestly dressed like that, and you tell <em>me</em> the darkness will destroy meâ€¦</p>

<p>Sora says â€˜the darkness may destroy my body, but it canâ€™t touch my heartâ€™ and likeâ€¦ youâ€™re not going to be able to do much if youâ€™re just a heart are you, Sora?</p>

<p>Anyway at that point Riku tries to murder me. I really donâ€™t see how this is helping save Kairi, but I guess heâ€™s a Sith Lord now so whatever, heâ€™s fallen to the Dark Side and wonâ€™t become good again until we beat him up. Luckily, Goofy changes his mind about the whole â€˜betrayalâ€™ thing. Donald decides to do the same (he totally wouldnâ€™t have done if Goofy hadnâ€™t Â¬Â¬)</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Goofy saying to Donald 'Well, you know... All for one and one for all.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-05.png">
</figure>

<p>Sora says he has a better weapon than the Keyblade: his heart! More importantly, I can still cast spells just as well without a keyblade. But I think Iâ€™m about to get a sweet heart swordâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦nah, the Keyblade came back. I guess it liked Soraâ€™s little speech about friendship.</p>

<p>The Riku fight is a bit of a slugfest, and not too difficult. Probably going to be another phase thoughâ€¦</p>

<p>Rikuâ€™s new outfit is dispelled, indicatingâ€¦ uhâ€¦ heâ€™s not into goth anymore? Anyway I finally get the white Trinity. Thereâ€™s a lot of places Iâ€™ll want to go back and use that.</p>

<p>Party reformed (+ Beast, who came back after the fight), itâ€™s time to explore. Thereâ€™s a door with four slots, which presumably takes some macguffin to open. (The hint text is like a riddle, but I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything in my inventory that fits.)</p>

<p>Instead, I find a library. Reshelving a book opens a secret passage, which must be really frustrating for the librarian. In fact seven or eight books need to be correctly reshelved before the final secret door opens, in the process completely rearranging the library. But that last door just leads to a lift that goes to a place with nothing I can interact with, and a chest thatâ€™s just out of reach of my jump. Maybe it will be important later.</p>

<p>Back in the room where I fought Riku, there are various small puzzles to solve to get four pieces of the Heartless emblem.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Four pieces which together form the Heartless emblem in pastel colours, placed into slots." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-06.png">
</figure>

<p>Not sure how Riku got through the door without doing that. Sorcery, probably.</p>

<p>Speaking of Riku, heâ€™s getting a visit from a Robe Guy:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku in his old outfit facing a brown-robed figure with a blue glow, that's saying 'The heart that is strong and true shall win the Keyblade'." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-07.png">
</figure>

<p>Apparently the Keyblade doesnâ€™t care about like, politics or good intentions or anything, and Robe Guy encourages Riku to get a stronger heart.</p>

<p>â€˜Plunge deeper into the darknessâ€™ says the mysterious Robe Guy. Riku, donâ€™t listen to this cr- Riku, what are you doing? Riku, you get out of this green smoke this instant young man!</p>

<p>There follows a maze of lifts that kind of reminds me of the teleporters in the original Half-Life.</p>

<p>Oh, I figured out how to lower the too-high-to-reach chests! You have to cast the gravity crushing spell on them.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Maleficent and Riku in front of a large heart-shaped portal with red, green and blue light inside. Maleficent is saying 'Unlock it and the Heartless will overrun this world.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-08.png">
</figure>

<p>That guy is back with a extra-evil voice filter! Ready to complete the evil plan which seems to beâ€¦ huh. Howâ€™s that going to be useful to Maleficent and Riku again?</p>

<p>Apparently itâ€™s just an acceptable side effect.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Maleficent explaining 'Rather, I will use its power to rule all worlds.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-09.png">
</figure>

<p>So yeah, Maleficent wants to rule all the worlds. Figures. To any particular end, or does she just like ruling things? I mean it will probably suck for everyone regardless, but like, what will she even do if she takes over?</p>

<p>I mean Iâ€™m just going to murder her so, eh, no big deal.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku holding out a red and black, sharp keyblade with Maleficent in the background." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-10.png">
</figure>

<p>Riku gets a new keyblade anyway. Itâ€™s red and black, presumably to signify that heâ€™s an anarcho-communist.</p>

<p>Maleficent comes to deal with us.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Maleficent looking towards the camera with an unimpressed expression, saying 'You poor, simple fools, you think you can defeat me?'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-11.png">
</figure>

<figure>
  <img alt="Maleficent, arms outstretched: 'Me, the mistress of all evil?'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-12.png">
</figure>

<p>The voice actress clearly had an enormous amount of fun recording these lines.</p>

<p>So - thatâ€™s pretty big talk. Letâ€™s see if she deserves her Chief Villain status.</p>

<p>â€¦OK, that was a fun fight. Good mix of boss and adds, for once the villain voiceovers werenâ€™t annoying (because they were just so over the top - METEORS OF HEAVEN, UNLEASH THY FURY!), felt like you were accomplishing stuff and there were even a couple of different ways to approach the fight. It wasnâ€™t super difficult, but it was cool.</p>

<p>So now itâ€™s time for that guy. Riku explains whatâ€™s so special about his Keyblade:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku facing Sora saying 'this Keyblade holds the power to unlock people's hearts.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-13.png">
</figure>

<p>Then he demonstrates on Maleficent to establish his status as new Chief Villain:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Rather than killing her, opening her heart to the â€˜true darknessâ€™ lets her turn into a giant dragon.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="An enormous black dragon with green fire around its mouth." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-14/img-15.png">
</figure>

<p>But this post is getting quite long, so weâ€™ll deal with the dragon in the next one!</p>
