excerpt: in which we beat up a house
---
<p>So itâ€™s Halloween Town, of <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> fame. Another franchise I didnâ€™t even realise was Disney (but I do know, thanks to half the internet, that the director was Henry Sellick and not Tim Burton).</p>

<p>Given the crossover betwen NBC fandom and Square RPG fandom, I imagine this level is quite popular. It also happens to be one of the few movies in this game that I actually remember watching.</p>

<p>The music in this level is an instrumental remix of â€˜This Is Halloweenâ€™, and the gang gets special Halloween outfits:</p>

<p>Goofy is <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7FyWBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CThat%27s+not+so+ignorant+after+all.+There+are+two+monsters+in+my+story,+not+one+And+one+of+them,+the+scientist,+is+indeed+named+Frankenstein.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DpHIHkjJf6&amp;sig=q4WaoCIxxF7FZeOgd4fcfACcrMY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBn5Lm_c_UAhVpDcAKHX1pBUoQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CThat%27s%20not%20so%20ignorant%20after%20all.%20There%20are%20two%20monsters%20in%20my%20story%2C%20not%20one%20And%20one%20of%20them%2C%20the%20scientist%2C%20is%20indeed%20named%20Frankenstein.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">one of the two monsters</a> from <em>Frankenstein</em>, Sora is a pumpkin vampire (I donâ€™t even know), and the illusion has worn off Donald Duck revealing his true form as the Archlich.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, the Heartless in Guillotine Square are not enemies. Perhaps theyâ€™re fake Heartless for Halloween purposes. Anyway the name of this square raises questions! Did they stage a revolution? Has Jack Skellington been beheaded? Is that why heâ€™s a skelligton?</p>

<p>In any case, Jack makes a dramatic entrance out of a pool of slime. But heâ€™s unsatisfied with halloween prep. I feel like the â€˜taking over christmasâ€™ plot of the original film is going to be changed up a bit here. And who is the villain? I donâ€™t remember really have a villain.</p>

<p>Jack, apparently, found a book on the Heartless. Presumably, the research journal Iâ€™ve been looking for, and gathered a few pages of. (Maybe I should check in on Squall with that?)</p>

<p>Mainly to move the plot along, Sora helps Jack and the Doctor unlock a heart-shaped device to help them make the heartless dance. This seemsâ€¦ questionably wise.</p>

<p>The experiment inevitably goes awry, and Jackâ€™s plan to fix it isâ€¦</p>

</figure>

<p>â€¦yeah, thatâ€™s gonna go well. But maybe weâ€™ll learn something of the nature of the Heartless?</p>

<p>At this point, three kids called Lock, Shock and Barrel jump out of a coffin. I kind of feel <em>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em> is a bit of an adult reference for this game/film? But then, they do literally have a guillotine in the square. Itâ€™s weird how execution devices are kind of considered kitchsy not-actually-scary these days. Like, a state decides it needs to dispose of so many people it decides to mechanise the process?</p>

<p>It turns out this movie did have a villain? A creature called Oogie Boogie?</p>

<p>Anyway, after a quick trip through a coffin(???) we get the final ingredient for the heart after memory, â€˜surpriseâ€™, here meaning a jack-in-the-box. I feel like if they wanted to be really surprising, theyâ€™d do something to break from the Halloween theme, or indeed the Kingdom Hearts milieu. For example, I would be pretty surprised if the final ingredient turned out to be a readable copy of Jennifer Diane Reitzâ€™s webcomic <em>Unicorn Jelly</em>.</p>

</figure>

<p>The three nefarious children make their escape in the most visually striking way possible, fittingly.</p>

<p>After some platforming mishaps, I get to making my way up Oogie Boogieâ€™s mansion. Who is in charge of Halloween Town anyway? The Mayor has the formal authority, Jack seems to be the de facto leader, and Oogie Boogie has the biggest house.</p>

<p>Then itâ€™s back to the activity that began the game: beating up children! We defeat Lock, Shock and Barrelâ€¦ but Iâ€™m going to type this sentence before resuming the cutscene: itâ€™s too late and we have to fight Oogie-Boogie anyway. Am I right?</p>

<p>Indeed, though we need to descend the manor and enter the torture chamber first. It does weird me out that something as deeply horrible as a room where human misery is automated is something that we can treat as one of those charming middle-ages kitsch things.</p>

<p>Anyway, the roulette-wheel themed boss fight isnâ€™t too hard once you figure out the mechanic. However, like a number of recent bosses, OB has a second phase where heâ€™s much bigger. In this case, he assimilates with his house, resulting in more of a platforming puzzle than a traditional boss fight. The result is actually pretty fun!</p>

<p>And, in a shock to everyone, beating the boss reveals the keyhole and allows Sora to seal it.</p>

<p>Onwards! Tomorrow, anyway, because I have to sleep.</p>
