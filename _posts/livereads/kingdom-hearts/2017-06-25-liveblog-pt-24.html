excerpt: in which we break Ansem and his weird phallus boat
---
<p>Unfortunately, I lost most of what Iâ€™d written to some kind of memory leak that completely froze up my browser (itâ€™s always Tumblr, too). So this is rewritten, not a liveblog.</p>

<p>So, the Big Ben Heartless.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A big black robe with a stylised glowing heart floating in front of it. Behind is the clockface of Big Ben." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-00.png">
</figure>

<p>Not that hard once I got a handle on the mechanics. Got a bit repetitive even. I can paralyse people better now. Not much use for it at this point, but yay!</p>

<p>Anywayâ€¦</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A double door opening, revealing blinding white light." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-01.png">
</figure>

<p>We open that door that we saw earlier. Behind is not darkness, but lightâ€¦ the poor videogame camera is getting overexposed.</p>

<p>Behind the door isâ€¦</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora, Donald and Goofy on the tropical island from the start of the game." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-02.png">
</figure>

<p><em>and you may say to yourselfâ€¦ this is not my beautiful island</em>
</p>

<p>You canâ€™t climb on all the things you used to be able to climb on, and thereâ€™s an invisible wall on the beach. Health and safety these days, I tell you. The only place you can try to go is the hidden room under the tree.</p>

<p>But then some VFX happened and the sea goes purple. Sadly it does not stay purple, but it does get all Heartlessy.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku standing looking out to sea on a fragmented beach, with purple material replacing vegetation in the background." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-03.png">
</figure>

<p>And guess whoâ€™s here?</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku again, but from the back." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-04.png">
</figure>

<p>Itâ€™s that guy!</p>

<p>Ansem/Riku has an argument with Sora about the properties of hearts. Ansem cannot speak anything undramatically. Itâ€™s great. He says all hearts are born from darkness. Sora is skeptical.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Ansem, back in his real form, saying 'You see, darkness is the heart's true essence.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-05.png">
</figure>

<figure>
  <img alt="Ansem saying 'Every light must fade, every heart return to darkness', with equations of entropy added around his head." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-06.png">
</figure>

<p>Something about him - the long coat, the lack of shirt, the extraneous straps, the long white hair with weird pointy bits that donâ€™t make a lot of physical sense - is reminiscent of Sephiroth, isnâ€™t it?</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Ansem floating, arms crossed, in the air with a Heartless behind him, while Sora runs forward to attack." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-07.png">
</figure>

<p>Anyway we fight him. He floats around with his heartless bf, and we hit him with sharp things. Heâ€™s not hard in comparison to the side bosses.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Ansem floating up into a tree, his cloak spreading out to show the red lining." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-08.png">
</figure>

<p>He goes flying into a tree. But oh no! It all explodes! Sure enough, this is a boss with phases.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A huge purple hole in the landscape, with the edges twisting into little spirals." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-09.png">
</figure>

<p>I have to say, I think Ansem has done some nice stuff with this purple curly hole. Maybe if he survives, he can go into landscaping instead of uhâ€¦ whatever his endgame is. Darkness something.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora in the large purple cavity, fighting a big Heartless with a tentacled face." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-10.png">
</figure>

<p>Sora gets split from the party and the first boss comes back! I guess it heard there was a fight on and wanted to join in. After all, it did invade this island - perhaps it lives here now. In any case, despite some new attacks, itâ€™s even easier once you have magic and powerful weapons.</p>

<p>Then, round 2 with Ansem. This time, Iâ€™m solo and he has more attacks, so itâ€™s not quite the same cakewalk. I get close to dying a couple of times, but itâ€™s not too bad. I beat him!</p>

<p>Then Ansem takes us to see his cool abyss. Time for a title drop: we see the Kingdom Hearts itself, the â€˜heart of all worldsâ€™ where all hearts come from. This kind of reminds me of Humanity and Darkness/The Abyss in <em>Dark Souls</em> a great deal actually. They use a lot of the same aesthetic markers. I guess itâ€™s not uncommon imagery.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A greyscale image of a void. Pointy shapes are floating near the centre, next to a small white double door." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-11.png">
</figure>

<p>I have to quibble with Ansem there, on account of a number of things being visible on account of light.</p>

<p>After showing us the Kingdom Hearts, Ansem has us check out his sweet boat.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A huge fleshy red-and-blue boat, with a scowling face on the front, ridges along the back, and a complicated pattern of platforms at the top. It looks kinda phallic." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-12.png">
</figure>

<p>You gotta respect someone who puts that many skulls on a boat. It could be a metal album!</p>

<p>Ansem himself is wired into the crotch of the big skeleton at the back(???)</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="At the top of the boat is another skeletal figure. A bunch of tubes extend from the pelvis, connecting to Ansem's back and holding him suspended in the air, where he's swinging some kind of puprle staff." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-13.png">
</figure>

<p>Does it like representâ€¦ the umbilical cordâ€¦ or something? Why there?</p>

<p>Anyway this is an aerial battle. Donald and Goofy are lost in the abyss. You have to destroy bits of the boat (mostly giant faces and skulls) one at a time by flying through portals into some <em>properly</em> dark areas:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora running through an area that's completely black except for a blue pattern on the foor. Two yellow dots represent the eyes of a Heartless." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-14.png">
</figure>

<p>Itâ€™s very reminiscent of the abyss areas in Dark Souls, such as the caves in <em>Artorias of the Abyss</em>, or that boss fight thatâ€™s just a huge dark infinite space. The Heartless totally vanish except for their eyes, which is a cool visual. Donald and Goofy are each trapped in one of these rooms.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve fought through one of these things, a red doodad appears:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora facing a glowing red orb in a dark void." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-15.png">
</figure>

<p>Destroy that, and part of the ship shuts down, or even blows up.</p>

<p>The first time you do it, Ansem some kind of <em>rebirthing</em> thing, just in case you thought there was a fetish that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> wonâ€™t explore.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Ansem emerging from inside the big demon at the top of the ship in a fetal position." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-16.png">
</figure>

<p>Snug as an evil scientist in a giant skeletogoth.</p>

<p>After you do that a couple of times, you have to destroy this purple thing:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A large sphierical unit surrounded by scary skulls. It also has a tiny face, that looks kind of gormless." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-25-liveblog-pt-24/img-17.png">
</figure>

<p>Aw, lookatit. On a ship covered in scary skulls, this one is pretty endearing. Sadly, you have to wreck it.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve done that, Ansem pops outâ€¦ and I need to eat, so I paused the game. Thrilling conclusion later this evening!</p>
