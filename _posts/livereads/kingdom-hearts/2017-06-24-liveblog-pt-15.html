excerpt: in which Sora somehow manages not to die from large keys
---
<p>The dragonâ€™s pretty hard actually. Does a lot of DPS, hard to predict/avoid its attacks, has the longest health bar of anything in the game. I was definitely reminded of Dark Souls in some ways, if only because thatâ€™s my only other major action-RPG lol. Dragon!Maleficent was not as terrifyingly hard as the last videogame dragon I fought, Darkeater Midir in the Dark Souls 3 DLC, but it was an intense fight and it took me about five tries to beat it.</p>

<p>Anyway once Drageficent dies, she completely catches on green fire (bright green is of course the colour of dark) and burns away. Metal.</p>

<p>That guy turns up again!</p>

</figure>

<p>Shock as the villain of this game <em>isnâ€™t</em> from a disney movie!</p>

<p>Riku leaves through another dark portal. But thereâ€™s still the portal we entered by, and the wall behind the save point disappears in true Dark Souls fashion.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora kneeling with Kairi in front of the portal." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-01.png">
</figure>

<p>Now <em>this</em> is a final boss room. Pipe organ stargate here we go!</p>

<p>Riku - or rather the entity possessing Riku, conveniently absolving him of moral responsibility - says Kairi is the final princess, and she needs her heart to produce the Keyhole. Which has to come from Sora.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku stands in front of the portal between the pipes, saying 'Don't you see yet?'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-02.png">
</figure>

<p>Going to guess what Sora doesnâ€™t see yet: through the magic of obligatory heterosexuality and also that thing Sora said about his heart being connected to the hearts of others, Kairi has given him her heart.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku shouting 'Kairi's heart rests within you!'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-03.png">
</figure>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku grandly declaring 'It is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-04.png">
</figure>

<p>What a twist!</p>

<p>Ansemâ€™s a Final Fantasy guy, I recall Squall saying. Interesting that he could be the villain here.</p>

<p>Ansem/Riku swats Donald Duck aside like a small duck.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Riku/Ansem standing over a kneeling Sora, commanding 'Open the door, lead me into everlasting darkness!'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-05.png">
</figure>

<p>Ansem, you donâ€™t think youâ€™re overdoing itâ€¦ just a bit?</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora blocking Ansem/Riku's keyblade with his own, shouting 'Forget it!'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-06.png">
</figure>

<p>This is a game about boys hitting each other with large keys.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have to fight Ansem without my party. Thereâ€™s very dramatic organ music. Somehow I think this is the final boss.</p>

<p>This game has a very annoying habit of putting checkpoints right before long cutscenes. Fortunately having an emulator lets you use savestates to bypass that.</p>

<p>The third phase of this fight is <em>really hard</em> actually. In the second phase, every so often he goes into a more powerful state. In the third phase, this becomes his default state, and he does an AoE on the whole arena every so often. It took several tries to learnâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦but I did it! I got good at hitting him during the powerful state/third phase, and figured out I could totally avoid the AoE by standing still in a corner and then be ready for his attacks after.</p>

<p>So he disappears. Is Riku dead? Aww he and Sora were going to kiss and stuff.</p>

<p>Donald and Goofy seem to have recovered, and the party observes the Keyhole is not finished, so Sora canâ€™t close it. They conclude they have to wake up Kairi, so theyâ€™ll need to free her heart, and Sora gets a terrible ideaâ€¦</p>

</figure>

<p>He does The Face right before this, but I wasnâ€™t quick enough to capture it!</p>

<p>Anyway this causes the ancom keyblade to turn into metroids, which are presumably in fact hearts, because all the princesses and finally Kairi get reactivated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Sora turns into a particle effect just as Kairi wakes up. Does that mean in the next game weâ€™ll be Kairi trying to rescue Sora? That would be cool.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Ansem's true form is revealed. He has long white hair, brown skin, white gloves, a long black coat, a long white coat underneath it, but no shirt. The Heartless emblem hangs right over where his heart would be." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-08.png">
</figure>

<p>This guy - presumably Ansemâ€™s true form - shows up!</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A glowing Riku saying 'No. You won't use me for this!'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-09.png">
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately for him, disposing of Kairi finally crosses a line for the host body. Riku buys time for Donald, Goofi and Kairi to escape.</p>

<p>And thenâ€¦ hereâ€™s twist I did <em>not</em> see coming.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A tiny Heartless - one of the standard enemies in the game - at the bottom of a flight of stairs." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-24-liveblog-pt-15/img-10.png">
</figure>

<p>Iâ€™m a Heartless now! Moreover Iâ€™m the weakest kind of Heartless! Turns out stabbing yourself in the heart with a magic key has consequences. :O</p>

<p>Canâ€™t wait to be murdered by my allies. Were we the real monsters all along? #makesuthink</p>

<p>As a Heartless, I can lope along, and I can jump. I canâ€™t press buttons, activate lifts, or the like. Somehow I have to get down this tower.</p>
