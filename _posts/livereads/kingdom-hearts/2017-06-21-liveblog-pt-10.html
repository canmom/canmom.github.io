excerpt: in which we help Pooh get his fix
---
<p>Now for a Winnie the Pooh interlude!</p>

<p>So yeah, we have two Torn Pages, so we can get two blocks of Pooh plot.</p>

<p>Piglet is not very big.</p>

<p>This leads to an incredibly fiddly minigame where Pooh gathers honey and you jump from branch to branch to protect him from bees. Only itâ€™s more like a game of jumping right over branches and falling to the bottom of the tree because this gameâ€™s platforming sucks.</p>

<p>After a few tries, I managed to get into a spot where I could spawn camp the final bees and got a perfect run.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Pooh leaning into a vast pool of honey, saying 'It is rather funny what I will do for honey'." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-21-liveblog-pt-10/img-02.png">

<p>Sadly, this led to no further rewards except this shitty rhyme.</p>

<p>Next stop is Rabbitâ€™s house, identifiable by its vegetable garden - as you know, the rabbitâ€™s capacity for small-scale agriculture is renowned.</p>

<p>Poohâ€™s here to hit up his dealer. Rabbit wants nothing to do with him, and especially not to share honey.</p>

<figure>

<p>Pooh is utterly remorseless. Naturally, he soon gets stuck in the hole. Then Tigger shows up and wrecks Rabbitâ€™s bridge, then expropriates Rabbitâ€™s farm as a bouncing ground, threatening the harvest. It really isnâ€™t Rabbitâ€™s day.</p>

<p>Saving Rabbitâ€™s harvest is another frustratingly fiddly minigame. And then Pooh wrecks even more of Rabbitâ€™s farm.</p>

<p>(This is clearly a parable about agricultural policy in the Soviet Union.)</p>

<p>Next up: whatever the next planet is.</p>
