excerpt: in which heterosexuality fails to detract from how cool my spaceship is now
---
<p>At this point my frustration over Kurt Zisa is ruining my enjoyment of the game and making me swear at my computer, which isnâ€™t a good look. Iâ€™m going to go back to the rest of the game, since as I understand it, Kurt Zisa is an optional boss. Maybe itâ€™ll be easier with a few more levels under my belt.</p>

<p>I spend a while crafting, grinding, and making the <em>Sevastopol</em> look much better. Then, I accidentally glimpsed on the wiki that thereâ€™s a special Hearltess in Neverland, so Iâ€™m going there next.</p>

<p>Tinkerbell tells us to go to Big Ben. We do andâ€¦</p>

<p>oh look, a sky friend!</p>

<p>Which meansâ€¦ aerial boss fight!</p>

<p>This boss has a weird mechanic involving the clock face. Every so often, numbers count down from 12 above your head. When this happens, I think youâ€™re supposed to hit the clock face? Not sure. When the number hits zero, that character dies, and unlike when they go to 0HP, canâ€™t rejoin the fight. Theyâ€™re no longer in your party.</p>

<p>â€¦ah, you can cast the Stop spell on the clock to temporarily postpone that! OK. This is going to be fiddly.</p>

<p>The other problem isâ€¦ the boss seems to have a special damage mechanic where it can only be hit by particular spells, at which point you deal a tiny sliver of damage and its vulnerable part disappears for a while. I can barely do any damage to it.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t understand this boss at all!</p>

<p>Checking the wikiâ€¦ I have the mechanics right. This boss is just hard. Damn.</p>

<p>Too hard for me right now I think. Iâ€™d have better luck with the other really hard boss. Whatâ€™s <em>with</em> these bosses?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not even sure what Iâ€™m supposed to do right now. I guess Iâ€™ll go talk to Cid, Squall etc. and see if they have any pointers.</p>

<p>OK, so turns out I missed something in the secret cave under Merlinâ€™s house. If you walk to the mural at the end of the tunnel (which I should have noticed had gone from moon to sun) you get a gummi!</p>

<p>This triggers some heterosexuality.</p>

</figure>

<p>Sora talks about being a Heartless. Kairi wants to join the party, but Soraâ€™s gotta masculinely do this manly task by his male self!</p>

<p>Anyway I get a new keyblade chain based on Kairiâ€™s lucky charm (looking at it, isnâ€™t that the <strike>Gay</strike> Fruit?). The shape and stats of the keyblade is determined by which chain you hang on it. Itâ€™s a way to let you upgrade the Keyblade without breaking lore that itâ€™s the same keyblade I guess. This one is slightly better than my current one, so, nice :)</p>

<p>I summon Bambi to help me grind items to make the best keyblade. Heâ€™s not very useful.</p>

<p>So I decide to press on with the plot. A mysterious wormhole has opened with the new nav gummi. I wonder where it leads.</p>

<p>Shock, itâ€™s Hollow Bastion! Who saw that coming?</p>
