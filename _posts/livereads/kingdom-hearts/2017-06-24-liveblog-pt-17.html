excerpt: in which Kurt Zisa kicks my ass and savestates canâ€™t save me
---
<p>So the next thing I did was go round and collect all the white Trinities to get some sweet endgame gear. (A trinity is a spot where your party can do an action from the canonical list of possible deeds: Jumping, Headbutting, Standing on Each Othersâ€™ Heads, Shoving, and Striking a Cool Pose. Usually this gets you an item, sometimes itâ€™s necessary to progress the plot.)</p>

<p>So my search (after a scouring of Monstroâ€™s fucked up anatomy) takes me to Agrabah, where the magic carpet wants to take me somewhere. â€˜Cool!â€™ I think, and hop on. It turns out the carpet is taking me toâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦a really huge boss! Fun.</p>

<p>In the first phase, it does something particularly obnoxious, and blocks me from using magic! I have to use potions for the first time in a while, because it hits like a freight train. It has a temporary health bar on each arm you need to break.</p>

<p>The second phase it sits on the floor and we see that the actual boss has about six layers of health bar. Far more than even Dragon!Malifecent.</p>

<p>Third phase is Zenyattaâ€™s ult:</p>

</figure>

<p>In this phase it can only be damaged by magic. When you beat that phase it goes back to phase 2, and you can chip away at the main health bar some more. I got through about two health bars.</p>

<p>This boss means <em>business</em>.</p>

<p>So, after I died, I equipped a <em>lot</em> of high-level healing items, and went in for another go! and another! and another! the good old Dark Souls tactic of throwing bodies at it until you get the hang of its moves.</p>

<p>But first I thought Iâ€™d finish getting the Trinities. I suspect there are a few of these super-bosses - they may even be what I need to advance the plot.</p>

<p>I go to Halloween Town and grab the white trinity. Iâ€™ve accidentally spoiled myself that thereâ€™s a very powerful Heartless that spawns in the Manor Ruins, probably another boss like that one, and that thereâ€™s a Trinity there I may/may not have forgotten. Letâ€™s see what I findâ€¦ OK, just a bunch of ordinary Heartless. Maybe thatâ€™s only in the 1.5 edition for PS3?</p>

<p>Back to the Hard Boss then!</p>

<p>I took Aladdin along instead of Donald for more melee DPS. This helped, and I quite farâ€¦ until halfway through its third last healthbar, a new attack was introduced, where it spins like a helicopter and zooms around the arena during the no-magic phase. Every time I got to that point I died.</p>

<p>I made a save state right before it starts doing the spin attack in order to practice, and then died to it like ten times without feeling like Iâ€™d learned much about how to beat it. I checked the wiki, and learned this boss is called Kurt Zisa. The hints arenâ€™t much help, but I guess I can try jumping over the horizontal spins. â€¦nope. But I am starting to get the timing down on dodging forwards/to the side.</p>

</figure>

<p>This is involving a <em>lot</em> of death.</p>

<p>At this point, I have spent all afternoon and still not gotten through this phase. Iâ€™m going to have to do it several times more to beat this boss.</p>

<p>It may not have as many attacks, but I feel like this rivals Nameless King for difficulty. Seriously.</p>
