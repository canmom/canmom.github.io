excerpt: "in which we suffer the worst weapon of the Heartless yet: free verse"
---
<p>The answer to “what’s in the hole” is a series of rooms connected by teleporters. In each one, a purple pillar takes you to a small segment of an earlier level with some Heartless to fight, representive of that level, and a chest tucked away somewhere.</p>

<p>After grabbing an item from each of these levels and sorta recapping the game, we come to a flashback room we’ve not scene, with a strange machine.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>It’s definitely very reminiscent of the machinery in Hollow Bastion. Perhaps this is what Ansem used at the start of his evil deeds?</p>

<p>We get some poetries when we examine it.</p>

<blockquote>“Ones born of the heart and darkness, devoid of hearts, ravage all worlds and bring desolation.<br>
Seize all hearts and consummate the great heart. All hearts to become one, one heart to encompass all.<br>
Realise the destiny: the realm of Kingdom Hearts. The great darkness sealed within the great heart.<br>
Progeny of darkness, come back to the eternal darkness.<br>
For the heart of light shall unseal the path.<br>
Seven hearts, one keyhole, one key to the door. The door of darkness, tied by two keys.<br>
The door of darkness to seal the light. None shall pass but shadows, returning to the darkness.<br>
Ones born of the heart and darkness, hunger for every heart until the dark door opens.”</blockquote>

<p>Hmm. So the Heartless want to achieve some kind of Instrumentality type deal? This is all quite cryptic. I note mention of ‘two keys’. Is one of them Riku/Ansem’s keyblade, or one we’ve yet to encounter? Also: title drop.</p>

<p>The time portal turns into a big hole. In we go!</p>

</figure>

<p>Inside we find a really big Heartless with big dragon/bat wings. Also we can fly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the big demon, it has a severe weakness to being hit in the face repeatedly.</p>

<p>We get the ability to fly faster. Handy!</p>

<p>The next rooms are a kind of diorama of some ruined buildings overrun with thorns.</p>

<p>Then we get to a green room. A Large Friend needs a petting. Then a door starts falling apart while Heartless spawn. That’s probably bad.</p>

<figure>

<p>After fighting many waves of Heartless (mostly the dark ‘Pureblood’ ones, but with the cool four-winged angel jar ones holding up the ‘Emblem’ side), that door breaks apart. We find… another door.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>There’s also a save point, called ‘final rest’, which is pretty damn ominous.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I’ll be able to keep playing after finishing this section, so I’m going to see if I can do the remaining crafting and get the Best Keyblade. And maybe try those two remaining side bosses.</p>
