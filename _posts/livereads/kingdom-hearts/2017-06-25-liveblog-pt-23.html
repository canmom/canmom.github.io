excerpt: in which we use quantum immortality to find the one universe where Sephiroth doesn‚Äôt utterly destroy us, and erase Christopher Robin from history
---
<p>So I started gathering crafting materials but after a while fruitlessly spent trying to feed enough corpses to Bambi in the time limit to get to the third level of the meter (with a 30% chance of the item I need), I gave up. Ultima Weapon will not be for me. I probably don‚Äôt need it anyway.</p>

<p>I will do the Big Ben boss though. And also the remaining Pooh.</p>

<p>Pooh is continuing to do a sterling job of performing his one character trait. Meanwhile, Tigger has some clunky minigames.</p>

<p>The remaining blank page is found in the Dalmatians‚Äô house, as a reward for finding &gt;50 of their children. This leads to a puzzle to reunite Pooh‚Äôs friends, who have simultaneously and independently gotten lost.</p>

<p>Goodbye to Pooh‚Ä¶ but wait. I hear there‚Äôs a keyhole to be found in the 0.4km^2 wood? Ah, it‚Äôs on the cover clasp.</p>

<p>So‚Ä¶ Sora has just completely <em>replaced</em> Christopher Robin, and nobody remembers the original boy? And Roo was there, but what about Kanga? This is a sinister ending.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Sephi-boy.</p>

<p>Just‚Ä¶ tone it down a little, Sephiroth? This is taking it a bit far, don‚Äôt you think?</p>

<p>Anyway through a lot of savestate abuse, I cheated my way to the third phase of Sephiroth. He just said ‚ÄúI am the chosen one!‚Äù and started glowing blue. And then things get <em>wild</em>.</p>

<p>Nearly everything is suddenly exploding or a giant rock and Sephiboy becomes invincible. This turns into a mode that‚Äôs sort of a bullet hell situation. Thank goodness for savestates, I would <em>not</em> want to have to go all the way through the rest of that every time I want to try the third phase.</p>

<p>Anyway, I cheated my way to victory.</p>

<p>Sephiroth explodes or something while T-posing. Or possibly Vitruvian Man. It‚Äôs probably symbolic of something.</p>

<p>As with the previous arena bonus boss, there are no actual rewards for suffering through Sephiroth except a vast dollop of xp. Apparently in one of the later edited versions of the game such as 1.5 Remix, beating Sephiroth gives you a conversation where he tries to corrupt Cloud ot the Dark Side but Cloud won‚Äôt do it.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs Sephiroth. One boss remains.</p>
