excerpt: in which a genie lacks imagination and we learn to paint
---
<p>We traverse a wormhole, which is packed with Heartless ships. Where did the Heartless get their enormous gummi armada?</p>

<p>The next stop turns out to be Aladdin-country, â€˜Agrabahâ€™.</p>

<p>Why does every Disney film have to have a small comic relief character with some kind of accent that I think is New York? Going from Phil the Satyr toâ€¦ whoever this parrot is really highlights the similarity.</p>

<p>Malificent reveals something of their Evil Plan. Apparently these are specifically â€˜Princesses of Heartâ€™. Jasmine is the relevant one here, and she turns out to be eavesdropping.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Heartless in this area carry curved swords and wear turbans.</p>

<p>Aladdin, it turns out, is being eaten by the Sarlacc. But we soon rescue him and hurry back to rescue Jasmine. We get a condensed version of the Genie plot. Jasmine gets trapped in a centipede made of pots, so, boss fight!</p>

<p>Then, immediately after, another boss fight against the giant sand tiger that has all the treasure in it.</p>

<p>Once Iâ€™m in the Cave of Wonders, itâ€™s the standard battery of â€˜ancient temple/dungeonâ€™ traps: rolling boulders, things that shoot out the walls, enormous pits, etc. I loot some items, which Iâ€™m pretty sure was very much against the rules, but evidently not. The place kinda reminds me of Senâ€™s Fortress, to put in this postâ€™s gratuitous Dark Souls reference.</p>

<p>I got raelly stuck here and spent ages fighting back and forth through the dungeon to try and find the thing to unlock progress. It turned out what I needed to do was swim <em>up</em> a waterfall. Yeah.</p>

<p>â€¦not even that? that got me a decent item butâ€¦ still canâ€™t figure out what I need to do?</p>

<p>ugh in the end i looked up a walkthrough. apparently i just have to jump and hit the pillar I found like, an hour ago.</p>

<p>Jafar, at least, is an easy boss, even with his invincible genie backup. The main problem is that sometimes he hovers in places you canâ€™t reach. If Jafar was smart, heâ€™d stay in those spots and be unbeatable.</p>

<p>Like in the film, Jafar uses his final wish to become a genie himself. Unlike the film, this results in a giant lava hole appearing.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Naturally, we jump right in.</p>

<p>For an â€˜all-powerfulâ€™ genie, Jafarâ€™s rather uncreative with his powers, mostly resorting to throwing lava around while his parrot carries his lamp, which has a lot of health to grind through. (Fortunately, the parrot apparently does not think to fly over the lava where we canâ€™t attack it.)</p>

<p>Jafar dispatched, we return to Jasmine getting kidnapped, presumably by Maleficentâ€™s forces. Iâ€™m getting really frustrated at all the femlae characters in this game being damsels in distress (except Maleficent and the Final Fantasy characters, and the latter two donâ€™t fight or anything). And couldnâ€™t we have left Goofy to stand guard or something?</p>

<p>We escape in a short flight sequence. Oddly, the flight model is different from the spaceflight minigame, but itâ€™s easy enough. Given the whole sequence lasted maybe thirty seconds, I kind of wonder why they went to the effort of coding it?</p>

<p>It turns outâ€¦ Riku is the one who kidnapped Jasmine! The Disney Villain Council is thinning out with Jafar gone. Hades and Maleficent are still around, and Iâ€™m sure there were some othersâ€¦ indeed they are, for here comes Captain Hook!</p>

<p>Anyway I found the shop to buy colours, and spend like the next hour making a cool spaceship.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s more like it!</p>
