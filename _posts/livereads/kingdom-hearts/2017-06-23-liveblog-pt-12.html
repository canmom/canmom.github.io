excerpt: in which we throw ourselves at the ground, and miss
---
<p>Itâ€™s time for More Pooh. This time: Christopher Robin, I suspect.</p>

<p>Or not. No, this time our new character is Eeyore. Eeyore asks Pooh and Piglet to pull him out of a stream, and they justâ€¦ ignore the request. Wow, no wonder the guy is depressed.</p>

<p>OK, to be fair, they have no idea what to do, and itâ€™s Soraâ€™s swimming skills that save the day. How did these animals cope without him?</p>

<p>Our first task here is to escort Pooh to the swings. This is awkward because he will only follow you when you target him, so you canâ€™t look where youâ€™re going. And he will occasionally get distracted by pots of honey someone left lying around.</p>

<p>The actual minigame is just a QTE thing. You hurl Pooh through the air to search for Eeyoreâ€™s tail. Itâ€™s discovered when Pooh lands on the stand where Rabbit is cooking food, which raises the troubling implication that Rabbit was cooking Eeyoreâ€™s take. In any case, Eeyoreâ€™s tail is restored, he seems to be feeling a little better (&lt;3), and my enemy-paralysing spell is upgraded. Onwards! (I quickly visit the Fairy Godmother and gain the ability to summon Bambi. Best not summon Simba and Bambi at the same timeâ€¦)</p>

<p>Next stop: dropping in on Squall, Yuffie and Aerith to see if they have anything to say about those research notes Iâ€™ve been finding. â€¦they donâ€™t. OK. On investigation, the pages of Ansemâ€™s report turn up in the Journal screen.</p>

<p>One of the pages of Ansemâ€™s report mentions the origin of Gummi, which fell on his world in meteors. It is â€˜elastic to the touchâ€™, and â€˜when two pieces are combined, they bond easilyâ€™. Probably is the same stuff as gummi bears, huh.</p>

<p>So I set off for the next planet. But while Iâ€™m en route, who should intercept me butâ€¦ <em>Captain Hook!</em> <strike>Somehow this takes me from facing Captain Hookâ€™s ship in space to being aboard Hookâ€™s ship in Neverland.</strike> (edit: in retrospect, Hookâ€™s ship takes us prisoner, and flies back to Neverland.)</p>

</figure>

<p>Hey itâ€™s this guy!</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Kairi sitting at the bottom of the frame with a dull expression. Riku is saying 'That's right. While you were off goofing around, I finally found her.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-12/img-01.png">
</figure>

<p>Soâ€™s Kairi! Sheâ€™s looking rather the worse for wear though, because god forbid we have a lasting female protagonist.</p>

<p>Anyway, we get Peter Pan as our local party member, and Wendy is of course the designated Damsel in Distress.</p>

<p>Riku has started making shadow clones of Sora, which is somewhat alarming. But theyâ€™re not too tough.</p>

<p>Peter Pan and Tinkerbell pretend to give us flight powers but actually donâ€™t mostly becase Donald Duck was a jerk. Meanwhile, we learn Wendy is not one of the seven special princesses.</p>

<p>In Hookâ€™s cabin, we get a boss fight against Shadow Sora. Itâ€™s pretty tough because Shadow Sora keeps disappearing into the floor and reappearing somewhere else, but not <em>that</em> tough. In any case, Riku runs off with the unconscious (heart-devoured, apparently) Kairi.</p>

<p>At this point, you canâ€™t progress until you find a barely-visible trapdoor and let Peter abscond with Wendy. And thenâ€¦ Hook!</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora and Goofy face Captain Hook on the deck of a pirate ship. Hook is backed by pirate Heartless. Hook says 'To the ruins of Hollow Bastion, where Maleficent resides.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-23-liveblog-pt-12/img-02.png">
</figure>

<p>Hook reveals the name of whatâ€™s presumably the final zone. I assumed this would be a boss fight against Hook, but instead first Sora learns to fly! Presumably this power will only apply in Neverland.</p>

<p>Indeed so, but all the same, the flying mechanic is decent (basically the same as the swimming mechanic) and it <em>feels</em> really nice to swoop around.</p>

<p>Curiously, the word â€˜codfishâ€™ seems to be a deathly insult in Neverland.</p>

<p>In any case, Hook is a fun but fairly easy boss fight. Afterwards, we go to London for some reason. (In-game, they just say â€˜the clock towerâ€™, but itâ€™s blatantly Big Ben and the skyline is London.)</p>

</figure>

<p>This leaves me somewhat unsure what to do, but when in doubt, I guess Iâ€™ll fly back to Traverse Town.</p>
