excerpt: in which we fight many children and learn of Donald Duck's vast eldritch power
---

<p>Iâ€™m trying kingdom hearts, which I understand was basically the Homestuck of its day. Inspiration: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJG29vyQJbw">this Polygon video</a>.</p>

<p>PS2 graphics are actually pretty ok in a cartoony game like this, at least once you increase the resolution and turn on anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering in PCSX2 :) Sadly the control scheme, and especially the camera, is already kinda frustrating - i donâ€™t really understand why they bound it to the triggers rather than the right analogue stick and I keep accidentally changing menu items when Iâ€™m trying to change the camera.</p>

<p>The story is: I am a spiky haired child who had a strange dream about stained glass videos with Disney characters and friends asking cryptic personality quizzes. By day, I appear to live on an island populated by children, where the main activity is fights on the beach. My friends Beach Sephiroth and Only Girl are building a raft with me.</p>

<p>The children are clear that theyâ€™re away from their parents, and that at least one friend is from somewhere else that she canâ€™t remember. Sora mentions other worlds existing, so maybe thatâ€™s where their parents live, and this world is just like a cosmic daycare?</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not clear what everyone eats - perhaps they import food from one of the other worlds. The island is quite built up with wooden platforms, piers and the like, and a few small rowing boats. Did the children build this? The adults? Did it spring into existence fully formed as part of whatever magical process makes a tropical resort world?</p>

<p>The children all have very <em>striking</em> outfits. Jokes about zips are old hat now but I was kind of amazed by the child who wears a pair of shorts with different length legs (sadly no good screenshot). Looking closely at the texture itâ€™s one of those trouser-short things where you can unzip the bottom of the leg to make it shorter? â€¦where do the children get their clothes anyway?</p>

<p>Anyway I fight each of these children individually and then all three of them together. Thereâ€™s a parry system, but no Dark Souls style dodge-roll.</p>

<p>everyone has giant feet. Sora and Beach Sephiroth (whose name I missed) want to go out and explore other worlds because Kairi arrived from one (so I guess the other kids donâ€™t know why theyâ€™re on Tutorial Island?). Nobody knows why theyâ€™re on the island.</p>

<p>Beach Sephiroth gives Sora a special romantic fruit, which probably wasnâ€™t intended for a gay reading butâ€¦, and Soraâ€™s a total jerk and throws it in the sea.</p>

<p>at that point Donald Duck shows up as a wizard because the premise of this game is <em>really weird</em></p>

<p>soâ€¦ Mickie Mouse is now a king - and a king, it seems, with something of an obsession with enormous, monumental architecture (or perhaps it predates his reign). Is there an entire feudal system under Mickie? Goofy is a knight - is he landed aristocracy? Who was the castle built to defend against?</p>

<p>The walking brooms from Sorcerorâ€™s Apprentice appear to be staffing the castle. Is all the castle labour animated by Donald Duck, the court wizard?</p>

<p>We go back to the island. Beach Sephiroth turns out to be called Riku. I get to name a boat.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Text input screen, in which I am setting the 'name of the raft' to Potemkin." src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-19-liveblog/img-02.png">
</figure>

<p>Riku suggests a competition as to who gets to share the <strike>Gay</strike> Fruit with Kaori, who is one of the only two women on the island. Sora responds â€˜wait a minuteâ€™ presumably because he thought Riku wanted to share the fruit with him.</p>

<p>Sadly, I donâ€™t get to name my raft <em>Potemkin</em> because I suck at platforming and lose to Riku. I try again and also lose another six times, beating him only once. I guess this is more of a <em>Petropavlovsk</em> situation.</p>

<p>Anyway I have to get food. It seems that these children mostly live off wild plants and mushrooms. Perhaps theyâ€™re particularly nutritious on this islandâ€¦</p>

<p>While poking around I find a cave and trigger a cutscene.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Sora, a boy in a short-sleeved jacket with spiky brown hair, facing away from the camera in a dark cave. A subtitle reads 'One who knows nothing can understand nothing.'" src="{{ site.url }}/img/embed/kh/2017-06-19-liveblog/img-03.png">
</figure>

<p>A man in a brown robe is incredibly condescending to me. Any gravitas is rather undercut each time we see Soraâ€™s enormous yellow shoes. But hey, magic plot door! I bet weâ€™ll never find out whatâ€™s behind that.</p>

<p>Another cryptic sunset conversation, and then itâ€™s back to the Mickey Mouse kingdom. The stars are going out. That sounds bad.</p>
