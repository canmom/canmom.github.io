<p>So it looks like Chou and Lupiko are attempting to restore Uni to unicorn jelly status by searching out the original place where Uni got pissed on.</p>

<p>Lupiko has made a double-broomstick ladder-sledge thing.</p>

<p>“Explanation”: there was no Holy Unicorn but a halucinogenic flower. Hmm…</p>

<p>I have no idea why JDR is doing a ‘magic vs science’ thing here. Like… ‘magick’ is <em>clearly</em> a thing in this world. A ‘freak chemical accident’ that turns a slime into a Unicorn Jelly is functionally indistinguishable from magic anyway, and surely deserves further study because seriously what the heck that’s some chemistry there!</p>

<p>They go to stay with the Jellies, with promises not to go on a mass murder spree. It’s played for laughs but poor Jellies.</p>

<p>OK so our sex worker Jelly is a Conical Jelly who are widely disliked. Given portrayal and use of ‘he’ pronouns in conjunction with the bow, I’m thinking KayWai is like the Jelly equivalent of a trans woman?</p>

<p>We get a new threat: the ‘Impalists’, a genocidal human cult. <a href="http://unicornjelly.com/map00.html">And a ‘powers of 10′ map</a> of the Unicorn Jelly universe, taking after those various physics videos that show the universe on various scales in the style of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">a famous science video from 1977</a>. (Since that video was produced we have established that protons and neutrons <em>are</em> made of smaller particles called ‘quarks’ interacting through the highly fucked up rules of quantum chromodynamics.)</p>

<p>So now we firmly establish the weird cosmology: <a href="http://unicornjelly.com/map05.html">everything we’ve seen so far takes place on an enormous triangular ‘worldplate’</a>. The universe is packed full of similar worldplates. There is a sea at the centre of the worldplate, and desert around the edges. It doesn’t seem particularly huge.</p>

<p>The worldplates appear to be arranged in a regular lattice containing vast triangular voids. And this lattice of worldplates forms an enormous tetrahedron called the Universe of Tryslmaistan, bordered by the Universes of Pastel and Kruum-Aluoor in the ‘Multiversal Manifold’. Further away there is a sphereland, flatland, lineland and the Prime Material Plane that’s more familiar to DnD players.</p>

<p>OK so being a unicorn jelly and being a conical jelly are <a href="http://unicornjelly.com/uni048.html">basically different facets of the trans metaphor</a> I guess?</p>

<p>Because of the worldplates, the ‘stars’ in the night sky are triangular. The sun and moon are a ‘night orb’ Velu and ‘day orb’ Ashun. Approval of orbs.</p>

<p>Lupiko’s <a href="http://unicornjelly.com/alt17.html">literally just a Wiccan</a>. Is/was JDR also Wiccan as far as anyone knows?</p>

<p>The Impalists are increasingly causing trouble, anyway… major arc incoming I guess. We see them briefly in <a href="http://unicornjelly.com/alt18.html">an AU strip</a>… OK, Bryn, this vastly predates the release of <em>Minions</em>! <em>Vastly predates!</em></p>

<p>Uni discovering the unicorn power was in them all along gets <a href="http://unicornjelly.com/uni054.html">a cool 3D rotation gif</a>. Uni can now move incredibly fast I guess? This unicorn charge thing is not seeming like a ‘once per campaign’ power ha. So we get a Culture Mind style slo-mo sequence.</p>

<p>(I get the impression JDR would like the Culture…)</p>

<p>Anyway by <em>not</em> murdering everyone, Uni stops the fanatics from fanaticising. Nice?</p>

<p>The fanatics had barely been established so the crisis of faith kind of falls a bit hollow, honestly.</p>

<p>While there doesn’t appear to be a chapter break, the next strip introduces two completely new characters, so I’ll do another post.</p>
