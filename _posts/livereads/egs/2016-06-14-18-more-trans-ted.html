<p>transfeminine Tedd is outright canon by this point so maybe I should stop commenting on it but still. <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=424">oh tedd</a> :(</p>

<p>i’m kind of surprised tedd’s won me back over so quickly but it is so easy to read tedd’s crass attempts to perform masculinity as desperately papering-over transness, and that makes them, if still rather creepy at the time, at least <em>understandable</em>. god i hope tedd manages to find a safer, more supporting environment where they can come out without instant judgment from their peers and father.</p>

<p>apparently the Uryuomoco language can be instantly learned when an Uryuom rubs their antenna against a human’s forehead. and other languages too. that seems… naive.</p>

<p>something dramatic seems to be about to happen but</p>

<p>i’m sorry i read more about the pulse shooting and i’m feeling too messed up to continue this readthrough now.</p>

<p>we’re at page 430 out of about 2000 now, so we’ve read about a fifth of the comic.</p>
