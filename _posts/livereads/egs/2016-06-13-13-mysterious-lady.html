<p>a <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=288">stranger</a> arrives at the comic book shop. she’s actually drawn distinctly from the other female characters!</p>

<p>her name is Melissa and she is trying to get Justin (who is gay) to date her. eugh.</p>

<p>so like a few strips after the comic about how kids use ‘gay’ as a pejorative, we get <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=291">an apology from some kid</a>. it’s kind of awkward. i dunno if it would persuade anyone who doesn’t already understand that it’s shitty to use ‘gay’ as a pejorative. this is also one of the comics i visited on my 100-at-a-time scan through the comic. a lot happened in those 100 strips actually!</p>

<p>oh i checked the dropdown and apparently we’re out of the Sister arc and we’re into the ‘new and old friends’ arc. and starting the second-sub arc: Lady Mysterious. featuring a lady, who is mysterious. (and has green hair, but is apparently not Liz, the previous green-haired character).</p>

<p>green-haired character turns out to be Grace’s latest transformation. what a mysterious mystery! (presumably a disguise from her brothers).</p>

<p>we are informed that green hair!Grace is Asian. and that this ‘Chloe’ form is a new setting on the transformation gun that has the same effect regardless of who it’s applied to.</p>

<p>The word ‘transgender’ is used in the comic for <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=298">the first time</a>, in the context of a Smash parody. there is some awkward commentary that uses phrases like ‘anatomically’ male or female. it’s… ok well it’s obvious that 2014!Dan Shive is barely less clueless than 2003!Dan Shive.</p>

<p>which makes me wonder how I picked up the Discourse so quickly when i came out? like i guess it’s a case of being hyper-obsessed with being ‘correct’ and spending a lot of time online anyway and therefore wanting to learn the ‘right’ way to be trans, the ‘most correct’ discourse and terminology or whatever.</p>
