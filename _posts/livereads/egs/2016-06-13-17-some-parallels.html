<p><a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=304">gratuitous author insert</a> in a narrator function; making the fourth wall literal and having the author-insert interact with it; the author-insert has an assistant character; the author insert is generally made to look silly</p>

<p>the story involves many different alternate versions of the characters from slightly different realities, which interact</p>

<p>there are aliens</p>

<p>a large proportion of the cast is gay or bi</p>

<p>everyone has magic powers and abilities</p>

<p>(of course many of these are general webcomic tropes that are hardly unique to homestuck and EGS, but still. maybe we’ll have a time travel storyline soon to seal the deal…)</p>
