<p>At this point I took a brief hiatus, and resumed when overwhelmed by events in the news.</p>

<p>we’re picking up with… ok, so, to remind myself of everyone’s names, Elliot and Tedd are going to break into a government building to steal a thing that will cure Elliott’s acute case of girl. Grace is at home, and Greg the martial arts instructor is on guard (in case Grace’s fellow furries show up I guess).</p>

<p>We learn that Greg can detect a change in ‘power level’ when Grace changes forms, and Greg explains the nudity taboo to her, which is as bad as it sounds.</p>

<p>Commenting on Greg, who wishes he was more of a shallow cliché, Dan Shive talks about the anime trope of old martial arts instructors having no sense of boundaries and sexually harassing younger female characters (except he phrases it as a ‘dirty mind’).</p>

<p>Grace <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=178">gets a call</a> from Tedd from ‘another dimension’. <strike>I guess they’re going to scratch their session later</strike>.</p>

<p>In the AU, Elliott has a counterpart who’s a girl (presumably cis) named Ellen, who’s in a relationship with Tedd. Grace informs ‘Beta Tedd’ that Ellen is Elliot’s counterpart, which he considers a ‘mood killer’, because he’s a transmisogynist homophobic piece of shit I guess. :)</p>

<p>Apparently there’s a naming theme for the chapters in the Sister arc, recounting a board game that goes to shit and ends in a fist fight.</p>

<p>In the government facility, Tedd and Elliot find the Dewitchery Diamond without complications, and Elliott touches it. There’s a cliffhanger where he appears to split in two: a version with a normative male body, and a version with a normative female body.</p>

<p>F!Elliot (who the commentary calls Ellen, but I’m going to wait until the character asserts a gender and name) is afraid that death may come with the end of the curse, in less than a month.</p>

<p>Ellen adopts a name in the next strip, calling herself the ‘evil twin’ of Elliot. Do these kids have nothing but bad TV in their lives or what.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=187">Awkward euphemisms for boobs</a> ahoy.</p>

<p>Dan Shive <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=188">talks about upper body strength</a> in an awkward way. For the record:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is true that, as a statistical average, men as a population have a slightly higher average upper body strength than woman</li>

  <li>there is significantly more variation within each group than between them</li>

  <li>top male athletes generally have higher upper body strength than top female athletes in a particular discipline, but there are complicating social factors</li>

  <li>there is no natural definition of a ‘female version of’ a person. all sex characteristics can vary independently, at best we have statistical correspondences that are deliberately maintained by power (through coercive pressures on trans and intersex and gender-variant people to look like white supremacist norms of cis non-intersex people, and through non-consensual surgeries on intersex babies)</li>

  <li>for CAMAB trans people, taking anti-androgens often leads to a loss of muscle tone, and it takes more work to build muscle, but that’s not what this magic gun is doing</li>

  <li>in fact… the capabilities of a magic sex characteristic change gun are entirely up to the author! the author can say that it reduces muscle tone, reflecting the trans metaphor, but that is <em>a choice</em> - there is no ‘natural’ way to determine what loss of strength a ‘female version’ of a character would have</li>
</ul>

<p>anyway Ellen has decided to fuck everything up for Elliot for some reason, but Elliot stops her from escaping. eh.</p>
