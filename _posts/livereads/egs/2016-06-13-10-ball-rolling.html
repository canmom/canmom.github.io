<p>the baffling government facility has no glass in the windows, but does have a barred cell in the basement. into which elliot and tedd are thrown. ok then.</p>

<p>elliot verbally acknowledges the likely consequences of head trauma, but we appear to be operating on a cartoon model of injuries here.</p>

<p>ok like <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=195">this</a>? is not how you do readability, or indeed how you do comic layouts. to spare your eyes, a tl;dr: there’s a wizard and a werewolf. wizard makes a diamond to cure werewolf. it splits werewolf into man and wolf. wolf rampages and kills man who was werewolf. oops.</p>

<p>so elliot and tedd contnue to be crass misogynists, and to nobody’s surprise i’m firmly on ellen’s side. the guard lets them go (what a pointless subplot) and we learn how tedd’s foreshadowed belt works, and apparently it’s a belt with ‘human’ and ‘feline’ on it.</p>

<p>comic <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=199">sharply veers</a> into furry lactation fetish or something</p>

<p>so yeah elliott turns into a cat dude and this will make him faster or some shit. Even 2014!Dan Shive can’t make sense of this.</p>

<p>meanwhile back home Ellen goes to school in a fancy suit. she’s crassly boundary-violating on another female student in an effort to frame Elliot, but the other girl, Liz, refuses to tell on her. yay student solidarity or something. (i was a shitty teacher’s pet in school who told the teachers about everything.)</p>

<p>Ellen shouts at the creepy geology teacher. well-deserved.</p>

<p>anyway there’s a joke about how Ellen doesn’t understand PMS yet (when one of the teachers makes her talk on a topic for two minutes as a ‘punishment’). what, do they not have sex-ed in this school? it’s not some great fucking mystery! (admittedly i would want to check on terminology before delivering a two-minute speech but like the basic concepts are pretty straightforward)</p>

<p>back at Tedd’s house, Grace gets a video message explaining the situation, rather too late.</p>

<p>in school, Ellen beats up the football player bully guy. ugh like, the flat bully character in Gunnerkrigg got character development quite fast, but this guy is still a one-note character.</p>

<p>the “““running joke””” of the principal looking like Hitler finally ends. thank fuck. didn’t really need to be lampshaded but w/e, at least that’s it.</p>

<p>Ellen runs into Sarah, and legs it. She hides in the girls’ bathroom and cries. :(</p>

<p>Sarah finds her. Ellen kisses Sarah, then runs away again. But then a monster shows up so she runs back and grabs Sarah and then starts running away once more.</p>

<p>The monster - the goo from much earlier - is <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=218">apparently</a> under command of a ‘Lord Tedd’, who has it out for our familiar ‘Weak Tedd’.</p>

<p>Susan at least is pretty unflappable in the face of all this anime bullshit, and turns on the fire alarm. OK.</p>

<p>Greg and Grace show up at the goo scene. Dan Shive has Susan - his ‘feminist’ character - call up Nanase for help but call her a slut, because that’s what feminists do.</p>

<p>Further explanation: apparently the familiar Tedd is not the Alpha Tedd, but Lord Tedd is. So there are three known Tedds: ‘weak’ Tedd, Lord/Alpha Tedd, and Beta Tedd.</p>

<p>Ellen discovers she can shoot green laser beams out of her hands. It resembles (we are told) the ray from the transformation gun.</p>

<p>Susan shows up with… <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=228">lines that read very uncomfortably</a> as a trans woman (’woman with a man’s mind’ in reference to Ellen).</p>

<p>We get a huge exposition dump. So apparently Lord Tedd wants to kill the other Tedds, and uses marble-sized evil things to this end. One of these is powering the goo.</p>

<p>Nanase shows up with <em>yet another new character</em>; this one is called Justin.</p>

<p>She creates a green double image to taunt the goo away from Ellen, leaving a purple version of her to talk to Ellen. When the green one is destroyed, she turns yellow and sends a blue one. Complementary colours, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Grace reveals a new power: she can freeze the goo’s arms in place. OK cool. Actually it’s an old power that I’ve forgotten about, just plain old telekinesis. She needs to transform into a form with more psychic power or some shit. So she reveals a genuine new power: she can combine her transformations.</p>

<p>We learn that Grace’s alternate universe double in the Alpha universe is a ‘General Shade Tail’. And that her anime hair is like, actual antennae.</p>

<p>Ellen stuns the goo with the transformation ray mid-boss-upgrade and jumps in its mouth while using her shouted-Japanese attack. This causes her to get hit by the&nbsp;“female form #5″ beam, which…</p>

<p>i can’t actually tell, and the commentary doesn’t help. makes her bigger or something? whatever it does causes the goo to explode.</p>

<p>a few commentaries after it was said, dan shive <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=243">acknowledges the “slut” comment and implies he regrets it</a>.</p>

<p>when the goo is finally defeated and squished, we catch a brief glimpse of Lord Tedd. He has a fancy tech gauntlet, long hair, and no shirt.</p>
