<p>Unlike some of the previous comics we’ve covered here, OHS is by a pretty experienced comics author and begins in a much more planned way.</p>

<p>So we open with some nice dialogueless panels showing a tired looking older white guy going home. His name is Al and he looks like a robot engineer of some kind.</p>

<p>And he’s bleeding. There’s a nice contrast between the bluescale of the scenes in general and the bright red blood. He’s probably dead.</p>

<p>Then he wakes up somewhere very different. This guy’s one of our protags.</p>

<p>It’s the future and there are robots!</p>

<p>And Al designed most of them! He’s been sixteen years dead and been rebuilt as a robot.</p>

<p>He worked with someone called Brendan Pinky who continued his work and caused there to be robots everywhere. I’ve read this comic before so I won’t spoil their relationship, though saying that probably spoils a lot already. Brendan looks a lot younger and more excitable.</p>

<p>Brendan lives in a building that I guess might count as brutalist architecture? It’s big in any case.</p>

<p>Unexpected reveal: Brendan was not expecting him. And other people have sent rebuilt Als to his door.</p>

<p>Al seems to know exactly what to say though. Hugs! :D</p>

<p>We get some reveals about the situation and the characters’ relationships and so on.</p>

<p>Now for the reveal of the comic’s like, <em>thing</em>: Brendan <em>also</em> made a robot copy of Al, and she’s <em>not</em> an exact copy. She <em>is</em> a trans girl. Al isn’t.</p>

<p>So now you know why I find this comic so interesting!</p>

<p>The greyscale-but-tinted art style isn’t super complicated but it works very well - and it does a fantastic job of good facial expressions, body language etc. It’s like a published comic in that respect. There are long sections with no dialogue that are still compelling and have a lot of emotional weight.</p>

<p>We end with a quote from Karel Čapek’s book <em>Rossum’s Universal Robots</em>, which is where the word ‘robot’ originates.</p>
