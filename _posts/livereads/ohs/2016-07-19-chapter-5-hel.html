<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hel_(being)">Hel</a> is of course the queen of the underworld (also called Hel) in Norse mythology.</p>

<p><a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-5-page-4/">ouch ouch</a>
</p>

<p>OK I was being inattentive - the last flashback is not when Al died. But <em>this</em> one is either it, or only a few months before it.</p>

<p>Oh wow they’re <em>really</em> <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-5-page-15/">falling apart here</a>.</p>

<p>oh gosh this is painful.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>…oh wait that’s it. I’ve caught up. I thought it would go on longer than that?</p>

<p>Well uh, ok, there we go everyone, that’s O Human Star! I’m really glad to be caught up with it and I’m going to be keenly keeping up with it.</p>

<p>I admit I kind of thought there would be more but then webcomics only move so fast and I think this one may only be like, 1/week.</p>
