<p>That’s a well cool title and I’m excited to see what it’s a quote from from.</p>

<p>Sulla breakfast sequence!</p>

<p>The idea of having a trans girl robot is pretty interesting, and it’s a comparison that many trans women have made (my fave being <a href="http://aliendovecote.com/images/witch1.png">Porp’s take</a>). A lot of the stuff that trans women experience - being considered ‘fake’ women, not human, disposable tools for mens’ gratification at best and dangerous abominations at worse - closely reflects fictional tropes around robots so you can see why we go there so often.</p>

<p>Anyway Sulla is a <strike>robot</strike> synth who’s cute and trans and can fly so I’m already pretty gay for her.</p>

<p>Speaking of gay like I’ve read this comic before so I already know but I think it’s already pretty obvious that Al and Brendan were a couple.</p>

<p>Capitalism is still a thing. Al and Brendan founded a company called Sterling Corporation who make robots; Brendan is the CEO.</p>

<p>Anyway the comic changes from blue to red tint, which I’m pretty sure indicates the start of a flashback sequence, a conclusion also strongly suggested by the fact the drawing depicts a younger Brendan in a less futuristic place.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is the first time Brendan met Al. We’re going to establish their relationship pretty hard I think!</p>

<p>Brendan passed the Turing test <em>at university</em>. That’s pretty hardcore! Al was still a big grump.</p>

<p>Pretty astute comment from someone called Markus that I’ll just quote in full:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hmm…apparently, they seem to have had this conversation before…</p>

  <p>Something tells me that Al “wanting to be alone” was a major point of contention in their relationship, for both him and Brendan. &nbsp;Brendan definitely seems pissed off about something greater than Al ignoring his advice insisting Al stay in the house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually the comments are remarkably nice on this website! They’re probably moderated I guess.</p>

<p>Back in the flashback – oh my god they’re flirting so much.</p>

<p>I think there is something of a character-focussed dudeslash/yaoi webcomics scene written by mostly cis women - <em>The Less Than Epic Adventures of TJ and Amal</em> is the most prominent example I can think of, but there’s also <em>Starfighter</em>, and various others - if you look at the <em>Smut Peddler</em> contributors list then you can probably get a pretty clear picture. But most of them don’t have trans girls so I probably won’t cover them here.</p>

<p>Brendan is 23 years old but with huge plans. Al is… older, not sure how old. I hope Brendan’s grandiose vision goes better for him than mine did, lol.</p>

<p><a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-2-page-29/"><em>gay</em></a>
</p>

<p>Honestly there is no higher praise I can give than ‘gay’.</p>

<p>OK so I think <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-2-page-31/">this take on AI</a> is rather naive - every single synapse is <em>ridiculously</em> complicated in how it functions compared to say, a transistor, and even for animals with mere hundreds of neurons whose interconnections and genome are known (the only one so far being the 1mm long nematode worm <em>C. elegans</em>) it’s a huge challenge to try to simulate the worm’s basic behaviour. (There is an <a href="http://www.openworm.org/">open source project</a> to do just that if you’re interested!)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it works for dramatic purposes. The robot stuff is relevant insofar as it affects the characters, it doesn’t have to be a “realistic” depiction of the actual state of AI research. And the point is that they get <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-2-page-32/">very excited and gay</a>.</p>

<p>But Al is pretty uncomfortable with the idea and keeps pushing Brendan away and oh gosh it’s a very believable dynamic but I worry about them.</p>

<p>Despite being significantly younger I think Brendan understands relationships and stuff a lot better than Al anyway they’re finally going to kiss thank goodness</p>

<p>Honestly it’s short but I think this is a really well-done little romance.</p>

<p>Also, they fuck.</p>

<p>Oh wow it’s Al’s first time, I forgot that part. No wonder he was so awkward.</p>

<p>Also Brendan is Jewish, that’s a nice detail!</p>

<p>Like this is just really good storytelling and ironically I don’t actually have much to say about good storytelling. I just complain about stuff.</p>

<p>Al is celebrating his 40th birthday on Hannukah so I guess he must have been 39 when he met Brendan.</p>

<p>The title is apparently to a song by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips">The Flaming Lips</a>. The song title itself refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_of_the_Magicians">an early and influential occult book</a> from the 60s.</p>
