<p>It turns out, while androids do dream, it is not of electric sheep.</p>

<p>This is significant for AI research.</p>

<p>Also Sulla is remembering something of the circumstances of Al’s death…</p>

<p>While robots tech and AI has ludicrously outpaced our own, blogs are apparently still a new thing in alt!200X.</p>

<p>Uh-oh. A call from the US Military. They want Al to work with some other robotics companies with the prototype neural emulator. <em>Definitely not for defense purposes</em>. Suuure.</p>

<p>(It is true of course that today’s most sophisticated robotics, such as Boston Dynamics, mostly seem to get their contracts from the US military.)</p>

<p>Well, he signs up for it for $20 million. But the US guy basically wants to sideline Brendan, and there’s good reason to think they won’t be cool about Al being gay.</p>

<p>Also you know. Don’t trust the US military to have anything but global imperialism at heart.</p>

<p>Back in the future, Lucille is still around! Also seems Brendan is out as gay to her at least. I get the impression that these AI geniuses have some kind of clique going on.</p>

<p>As Brendan asks around about any suggestion of who built Al, Lucille encourages Brendan to talk a ‘mysterious inventor type’ with a blacked out face in Brendan’s phone who has been making ‘unusual requests’ recently. But whoever it is does not pick up the phone.</p>

<p>Clearly an enigma wrapped in a mystery bundled up in a sock and thrown into a conundrum.</p>

<p>Flashback: the military officers in the project are indeed a bunch of old white dudes who probably think Al is a lot more like them than he is.</p>

<p>Judging by a pin on his uniform of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius">Rod of Asclepius</a> (you know that medical thing with the snake stick) the military guy here was a doctor. So he was a neurosurgeon in the army medical corps and that’s why he’s into robotics etc.</p>

<p>Poor Brendan gets a bit talked over. And the army dudes creep on Lucille. Defiitely a big culture clash thing etc.</p>

<p>There’s some pretty cool stuff with Lucille and her feelings re: visibility of disability and prosthetics.</p>

<p>Honestly this comic does social interactions <em>so well</em> - so much good body language stuff, so much hinted in what’s said and what isn’t. It’s really taking good advantage of the medium. Like Lucille and Al’s frosty conversation… I want to be able to write dialogue like this.</p>

<p>God the army guys are being arsey to Brendan. Al and Brendan’s relationship is so realistic and well done.</p>

<p>Brendan spots some old self-harm scars on Al and… <em>doesn’t</em> deal with it well. Like ‘I want to take your sharp object away’ badly. But again they resolve it.</p>

<p>In the future… there’s an area of the city called the Synth Corridor where many of the Synths hang out. <em>Maybe</em> not a good place for Al to be.</p>

<p>Mystery person calls back and is totally unhelpful and quite rude!</p>

<p>Back to Sulla and the other cool kids! Titus is trans and nb!</p>

<p><a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-4-page-57/">“Like a robot or something”</a> <em>ouch</em></p>

<p>So there’s a weird interaction where the robot at the counter won’t get Sulla her food and a human assistant takes over.</p>

<p>I wonder if <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-4-page-62/">this demonstration</a> of the presence of iron particles in food would actually work that well? It’s not one I’ve seen before.</p>

<p>In a commentary, there’s a reference to an artist, Sachiko Kodama, <a href="http://sachikokodama.com/en/work/">who works in ferrofluids</a>. Cool!</p>

<p>Pretty fascinating discussion <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-4-page-65/">in the comments here</a> about how the broth resulted in Sulla crying.</p>

<p>Lucille has an <a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-4-page-68/">all-woman robotics team</a> I think? That’s well cool.</p>

<p>I like how Lee is all ‘we can us the giant mecha for defence’ and everyone else is like ‘nah’. Good. Shut up the army man.</p>

<p><a href="http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-4-page-76/">Oh. Shit.</a> I think this is the point Al dies - what a horribly sad note to leave Al on.</p>

<p>Back in the present… Al kind of does a shitty job of being a robot prophet.</p>

<p>Oh gosh the big robot did end up working in construction after all!</p>

<p>Action scene time. I won’t narrate. It’s tense.</p>

<p>Oh gosh. She’s been outed as a robot. Oh gosh.</p>

<p>Chapter title refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_That_Wasn%27t">a somewhat satirical chilrden’s book</a> by animator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Tashlin">Frank Tashlin</a>. Tashlin's colleage Chuck Jones adapted it into a cartoon in 1976:</p>
