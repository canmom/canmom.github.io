  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> Right then</li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> Hello. I&rsquo;m canmom, this is my gf <a href='https://drc4ble.tumblr.com'>drcable</a></p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve only the vagues of memories of reading a handful of <em>Animorphs</em> books</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> I&rsquo;ve read them all, but forgot a lot?</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> I got interested in the series again after <a href='http://www.bogleech.com/animorphs.html'>bogleech&rsquo;s article</a>, and later after a friend posted an animorphs fic</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> you like the horrors of war and that shit</li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> apparently? 😐</p>
    <p>that probably doesn&rsquo;t say the best things about me</p>
    <p>&lsquo;here is a series about the traumatising horrors of war&rsquo; &lsquo;sign me up!&rsquo;</p>
    <p>So if you&rsquo;re not familiar with animorphs, it&rsquo;s a series of books by KA Applegate (and later, ghostwriters writing under her name)</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> and also like, kids who turn into monsters and cute animals</p>
    <p>it&rsquo;s not all like war and peace</p>
    <p>tho...</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> they&rsquo;re generally pretty short, order 25,000 words, but there are a lot of them. like 40?</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> 54, I think, in the main series? and 4 which are like, spin offs</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> which would suggest the series runs for about 1.4million words</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> what&rsquo;s that in <em>Homestuck</em>s</p>
    <p>and was I wrong about it being <em>War and Peace</em>?</p>
    <p>is <em>Animorphs</em> actually the <em>War and Peace</em> of our time?</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> it&rsquo;s longer than <em>War and Peace</em></li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> well then,  I&rsquo;m gonna brag about that</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> I think you&rsquo;ll find <em>Fallout: Equestria</em> is the <em>War and Peace</em> of our time :p</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> ok we&rsquo;re doing that next</p>
    <p>then we can compare</p>
    <p>we&rsquo;ll never actually read war and peace</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> <em>War and Peace</em> is about half as long as animorphs going by this rough estimate</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> just books that are longer and edgier and we&rsquo;ll look down our noses at men who love war and peace</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> it&rsquo;s also longer than homestuck, according to <a href='http://readmspa.org/stats'>readmspa</a></li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> and there&rsquo;s even like, live action sections</li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> so...</p>
    <p>the first book is called <em>The Invasion</em></p>
    <p>it has a frankly terrifying mid-90s CGI cover</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> this cover is even freakier than normal</p>
    <p>cos like, just his head transforms</p>

  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> that lizard looks so plastic</p>
    <p>and yeah what happens to the rest of him</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> in the rest of them at least they show the body morphing</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> this is actually the second cover of the book</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> but this is just... unusually monstrous</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> the first one they just showed a boy with a lizardy face</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s better but ok</p>
    <p>shall we like, read this?</p>

  <p>My name is Jake. That&rsquo;s my first name, obviously. I can&rsquo;t tell you my last name. It would be too dangerous. The Controllers are everywhere. Everywhere. And if they knew my full name, they could find me and my friends, and then . . . well, let&rsquo;s just say I don&rsquo;t want them to find me. What they do to people who resist them is too horrible to think about.</p>

    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> recuring themes that will happen here:</p>
    <p>the writing is bad. like, really bad.</p>
    <p>I say this while comparing it to <em>War and Peace</em></p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> i notice it&rsquo;s presented as an epistolary novel</p>
    <p>or somewhat so anyway</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> yeah that&rsquo;s kinda ignored other than every novel having an introduction like that?</p>
    <p>literally</p>
    <p>that paragraph</p>
    <p>with a different name</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> i bet there&rsquo;s more than enough info to potentially ID the authors for an enterprising yeerk</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> there&rsquo;s a thing on tvtropes ranting about exactly that</p>
    <p>like, [spoilers] the yeerks have one city which they&rsquo;re invading. the kids know this.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> haha wow. top marks for opsec guys</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> this is...not the worst opsec these folks have</p>
    <p>yeerks are just really stupid</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> I like how he introduces the apocalyptic stakes and then immediately segues into videogame highscores</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> sorry, 1s, I want to rant about the writing</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> please do 😃</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> cos, like, while I love animorphs</p>
    <p>there is no reason it has to be this bad</p>
    <p>compare and contrast with my fave YA novel (<em>Uglies</em>, westerfeld), which is aimed at the same audience, and is also really cracky:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.</p>
  <p>Of course, Tally thought, you’d have to feed your cat only salmon-flavored cat food for a while, to get the pinks right. The scudding clouds did look a bit fishy, rippled into scales by a high-altitude wind. As the light faded, deep blue gaps of night peered through like an upside-down ocean, bottomless and cold.</p>
  <p>Any other summer, a sunset like this would have been beautiful. But nothing had been beautiful since Peris turned pretty. Losing your best friend sucks, even if it’s only for three months and two days.</p>
  <p>Tally Youngblood was waiting for darkness.</p>

  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> KA applegate is a bad writer</p>
    <p>This kind of stuff is what gives YA a bad rep</p>
    <p>and for all her skill at like, writing fucked up shit I wish KA would be better at this</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> Westerfeld&rsquo;s is still pretty cheesy, but yes, it has a much stronger narrative voice</p>
    <p>i think maybe YA standards have risen since animorphs began?</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> eh, tell that to aesop</p>
    <p>(It&rsquo;s also a Gibson reference which is a nice way of bringing in the whole post cyberpunk thing)</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> is any reference to the colour of the sky a gibson reference? :p</p>
    <p>i mean i can see it</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> opening a novel with &ldquo;the sky was the colour of&rdquo; kinda counts</li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> yeah</p>
    <p>anyway so, before this becomes Ada&rsquo;s Cyberpunk Faves :p</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> It&rsquo;s also still in a teens voice?</p>
    <p>like, even &ldquo;jake is a melodramatic bastard&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t an excuse</p>
    <p>a teen would totally cool shit cat vommit</p>
    <p>there is not excuse for an opening line this bad</p>
    <p>is what I&rsquo;m getting at</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> idk, i think this is on the level of an average fanfic</p>
    <p>which is what a lot of teens write</p>
    <p>not a good fanfic</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> oh, fight me, 99% of fanfic is better written than this</p>
    <p>though, animorphs is like, more fucked up than ABO</p>
    <p>which is...impressive</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> are we talking ao3 or ff.net</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> like, it&rsquo;s better than most livejournal or wattpad</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> anyway so what do we have</p>
    <p>we have <em>mcelroy voice</em> boys</p>

  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> they did re-edits of these books</p>
    <p>to bring the references up to date</p>
    <p>I think they play COD not doom?</p>
    <p>in the new versions?</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> i have an old version then because sega still makes videogame consoles</li>
  <li class="person2">

  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> hypothesis: tobias egg</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> like, tobias is 100000% trans and hates his body</p>
    <p>but he&rsquo;s more like an extreme furry? than an egg</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> is &lsquo;furry&rsquo; supposed to be an argument against being a trans girl? :p</li>
  <li class="person2">
    <p><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> ...fair</p>
    <p>wait, do they ever solve the humans morphing into other humans thing?</p>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t remeber if they attempt it</p>
  </li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> idk do they?</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> we&rsquo;ll find out? I guess</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> anyway we now have GIRL</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> she&rsquo;s a girl</li>
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> you can tell, cos she&rsquo;s pretty</li>
  <li class="person1"><strong class="name">canmom:</strong> cassie and rachel, immediately described in terms of how pretty they seem to our highly heterosexual narrator</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>She has blond hair and blue eyes and that kind of very clean, very wholesome look.</p></blockquote>

<ul class="chat">
  <li class="person2"><strong class="name">drcable:</strong> she&rsquo;s also a nazi apparently. or maybe jake is</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Cassie is sort of the opposite. For one thing, she&rsquo;s usually wearing jeans and a plaid shirt, or something else real casual. She&rsquo;s black and wears her hair very short most of the time. She had it longer for a while, but then she went back to short, which I like. Cassie is quieter than Rachel, more peaceful, like she always understands everything on some different, more mystical level.</blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to be distracted because I was pretty sure I&rsquo;d heard the sound of a chain-saw killer creeping up behind us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just look,&rdquo; Tobias said. His voice was strange. Amazed-sounding, but serious at the same time.</p>
  <p>So I looked up. And there it was. A brilliant, blue-white light that scooted across the sky, going fast at first, too fast for it to be an airplane, then slower and slower. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I tried to spit it out, but I couldn&rsquo;t. The lizard&rsquo;s hunger for that spider was too great. I swallowed the spider. It was like swallowing a whole canned ham. A canned ham that was fighting all the way down.</p>
  <p>No, no, no! my brain cried in horror and disgust. But at the same time, the lizard brain was pleased. I could feel it become slightly calmer.</p>

  <p>You know, back in the old days — I mean, the real, real old days — the Africans, the early Europeans, the Native Americans . . . they all believed animals had spirits. And they would call on those spirits to protect them from evil. They would ask the spirit of the fox for his cunning. They&rsquo;d ask the spirit of the eagle for his sight. They would ask the lion for his strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess what we&rsquo;re doing is sort of basic. Even though it was Andalite technology that made it possible. We&rsquo;re still just scared little humans, trying to borrow the mind-of the fox, and the eyes of the eagle . . . or the hawk,&rdquo;</p>
