  <p>Jake nodded. “I think if you could ask the dolphins, they would say it’s all right to use them. Since what you’re trying to do is save them.”</p>
  <p>“Nah, they would just think it was all a big game. They would never understand.”</p>
  <p>We both laughed. Even if they could talk, the dolphins would never really understand what we were so upset about. We knew that better than anyone.</p>
  <p>“I guess that’s true,” Jake said. “But we do understand.” He met my gaze. “We do understand what’s at stake. And we’ll do whatever we have to do to win.”</p>
  <p>I knew what he was trying to tell me. We’d used the dolphins to save them. We’d used other animals to save them, too. And that made it okay.</p>
