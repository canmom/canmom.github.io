  <p>My name is Rachel. I won't tell you my last name. None of us will ever tell you our last names. Whenever I do use a last name, it's a fake. Sorry, but that's the way it has to be. And we won't tell you the name of our town, or our school, or even what state we are in. If I told you my last name, the Yeerks would be able to find my friends and me. And if they ever find us, it will be the end.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="person1">
    <p><b class="name">canmom:</b> but she's as given to melodrama as Jake</p>
    <p>so uh what happened to the animorphing cube</p>
    <p>like the obvious strat would seem to be to recruit more animorphs</p>
    <p>or, i hate to say it, but perhaps to reach out to the repressive powers of the bourgeois state? it would seem in-character at least</p>
    <p>then again, maybe capitalists find a yeerk alliance profitable</p>
