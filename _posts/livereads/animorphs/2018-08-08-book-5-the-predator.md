excerpt: "Last year, two (later, three) trans women set themselves a challenge: to read every one of the like, fifty animorphs books and make egg and forced femme jokes, which we can all agree the world needs. We got through like... four. Then life happened. But we're back!"

This log begins shortly after we realised my bot crashed.

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} ugh
  
  why is your bot so stupid bryn

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} yeah sorry i'm not like an entire software team working on this full time

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} for shame!

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} Let's just. We did a lot of great comedy in the preamble just now, and then we discovered the bot wasn't logging.
  
  So...
  
  you'll have to imagine, dear readers.

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} it was, honestly, the funniest thing you can ever imagine

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} we just can't tell you about it
  
  ever
  
  we're sworn to secrecy about the gomedy gold we produced
  
  more like platinum

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} The Yeerks will find us

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} "I can't ever tell you my excellent jokes. It's too dangerous."

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} belive me, I wish I could

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} I'll edit it in, it will take like twenty minutes tops

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} But hey at least we get to start off with "fix it in post" comedy?
  
  Which audience testing revealed to be the best kind of comedy?

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} I'll fixxx...wait no
  
  you've both had grs
  
  I can't fix your posts
{: .chat}

I did not, in the end, fix it in post.

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} anyway, we're reading Predator, the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} Interestingly they mention Arnold Schwarzenegger on the first page.
  
  Coincidence?

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} Also, I recall this book having a lobster morph on the cover.
{: .chat}

<figure markdown="1">
![Two covers of Animorphs Book 5 'The Predator'. One shows a very young boy transforming into a gorilla in a series of stages. The second, rather more poorly edited, shows the same boy transforming into a lobster.](/img/embed/animorphs/book5-covers.jpg)
</figure>

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} Which I looked up and I'm not wrong! It looks like they did different versions.

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} Yeah there was an earlier cover where Marco turns into a lobster

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} like, there can't be that many sea worlds

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} Someone in marketing decided lobsters weren't cool, which is bullshit because
  
  * non-mammal morphs are the best
  * lobsters are magic.

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} incidentally when I went to trans pride, there were a bunch of people dressed as lobsters

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} COINCIDENCE?

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} the reason was really bad but I can't remember it

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} shellies?
  
  mary, percy, etc...

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} "This is bad but I can't remember why" is basically what living on the internet is like.

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} oh yeah, it was like, they wanted the trans flag added to unicode! and for some reason that entailed dressing as lobsters

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} oh god no
  
  unicode's immutable!
  
  we'd never be able to get rid of the goddamn flag

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} Hey friends shall we finish the preamble and read about Arnold Schwarzenegger?

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} no
  
  100% preamble

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} 100% preamble, no sedative
  
  the audience will remain in anticipation of actual content to the very end.

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} like, we cojuld just not read the books
  
  and spend the entirity of every chat shitposting about the covers

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} that wouldn't be the worst thing
  
  but no

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} I'd say we'd get through it quicker but
  
  At this rate, maybe not.

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} we are here to see children... suffer? hmm.
{: .chat}

> So, see, I'd like to tell you my name, and address, and phone number, too, because if I could do that, it would mean I no longer had any enemies.

{: .chat}

> The first thing that happened was the fur. It sprouted quickly from my arms and legs and all down my body. Thick, rough, ragged, black fur. It grew long on my arms and back and head. It was shorter everywhere else.

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} I guess like, "punks" is the scholastic way of vaguley racialising things?

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} Can we please accidentally morphing pigs instead of shoulders?

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} There's probably something to be said about the 'violently intervening in a mugging' fantasy that's recurred for like, a century at least as the Standard Heroic Action

> If the punks had had any sense, they would have run.

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} honestly how many books are they gonna keep this ruse going for
  
  like at some point the dramatic tension's going to drain away

* {: .person3} **Transmutress:**{: .name} So here's my prediction:
  
  Marco's Mom is going to be able to stay Visser One's hand juuuuuust long enough for them to escape
  
  because emotions.

  i'm not sure who the specific Predator is

* {: .person2} **drcable:**{: .name} well the go on a lot about controllers?

* {: .person1} **canmom:**{: .name} but that was a pretty well paced animorphs book I think? we had three solid arcs in there

  Anyway, it's good to be back!

A few after-the-fact thoughts: those short, choppy sentences are really noticeable when you're editing a log. I guess that's just The YA Style though (c.f. _Maximum Ride_).

It feels like a significant chunk of these books has to be scene-setting preamble and plot-recapping by nature.

At this point, I feel like the status quo is in for a shakeup. We've had a number of iterations of 'the gang gets in a fracas with the Yeerks and narrowly escapes'. Over that framework, each book has its specific variations

1. _The Invasion_: setting the scene, establishing the plot
2. _The Visitor_: establishing the nature of controllers, building up Visser Three as a villain
3. _The Encounter_: exploring 'losing onesself' in a morph, establishing space stuff
4. _The Message_: introducing Ax to the narrative
5. _The Predator_: introducing Visser One and establishing that she's Marcus's mum

The promise of more complexity in the Yeerks has yet to be realised. So far, they remain Generic Evil Invader Species from just about any cartoon. But let's give it time.

So what next? And how long are they going to drag out 'the Yeerks don't know they're human kids not andalite soldiers'? Hopefully, we'll find out soon!
