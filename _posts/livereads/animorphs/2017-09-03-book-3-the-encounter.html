    <p><strong class="name">Transmutress:</strong> The setup of DS9 is that Bajor, a world of deeply religious people with great earings and cute noses, has recently been abandoned by the Cardassians, who are imperialist lizard assholes.</p>
    <p>And the Bajoran provisional government has asked the Federation to set up a presence in their system, mostly to keep the Cardassians away.</p>
    <p>And there's kind of interesting politics about independence and having to rely on playing major powers against each other in order to survive.</p>
