  <p>I knew just where I wanted to go. Wingtips actually hitting the ship on each downstroke, I raced toward the ship's bridge. Toward the tiny windows where I had seen the Taxxon crew. I could not save my friends, perhaps. But I could try to grant Rachel's last wish. I could try to bring this ship down.</p>

  <p>Then, with one sharp talon, I pulled the trigger on the Dracon beam.</p>
  <p>&lt;Fry, you worms!&gt;</p>
  <p>There was no recoil. Not like a regular gun at all.</p>
  <p>But a beam of intense red light lanced from me to the bridge. It burned a hole through the window, sliced through a fat Taxxon, and began slicing up control panels and instruments like a hot knife going through butter. I squeezed that trigger for as long as I could. At last, exhausted, I could do no more.</p>
