## Description
### Brief background
Sumi lived among a typical community of hardworking gay orcs in a clifftop village, dreaming of the Ancestors, flirting with other orc girls and dutifully attending to the small circle of stones. But after a spirit started causing trouble, she volunteered to deal with it - and a tense moment, discovered abilities she'd never imagined she'd had, and with them, manifested the Black Spot.

Which was kind of alarming.

Neither Sumi nor anyone else in the village had any idea what to make of these powers, but they recognised them as a curse. They pooled resources to send Sumi out to find out what had cursed her.

### Ideal
To live a bold, ingenious, romantic life like Grim, but also embody wisdom, care, and devotion like Seritha.

Sumi believes the way she approaches her struggles reveals her heart to the world - and she wishes to show a bold and kind heart.

### Bonds
 - **Ariel:** Sumi is kind of in awe of Ariel's knowledge of the world and skill, and a little intimidated by her. After Ariel revealed how worried she was about Sumi's curse, Sumi vowed to own her powers, be true in their expression, and never again let herself hide or lose control. Sumi does not want to hurt or scare her friends any more. Also Ariel shot Marat when he refused to listen to her; it was badass but Sumi is even more intimidated!
 - **Freya:** Freya was there when Sumi was born, and has known her all her life. She was the first person Sumi went to after discovering her curse. Sumi and Freya fought back to back during the lighthouse siege, and Sumi has hella respect for her. She feels proud to have had a part in helping reunite Freya and Gorta.
 - **Minerva:** Minerva lived near Sumi's village, and she and Sumi set out on their journey together. Sumi has taken her out dancing, but Minerva was a bit of a wallflower. Sumi knows Minerva doesn't always like to talk, but she wishes she could understand her better.
 - **Striven:** Sumi has been asking Striven for understanding of the Black Spot, and she's kind of attracted to her and thinks her magic is pretty fantastic. Sumi is trying to work out what would be a good tattoo to ask Striven to draw on her.
 - **Leviathan:** Sumi has been afraid of Leviathan, but she's determined to face her fear, learn what Leviathan wants, and do the best she can with these circumstances. She was very surprised to find Leviathan so amiable when meeting face to face. She's still suspicious that Leviathan may be telling her what she wants to hear, but she wants to give her a fair shake, and if the 'Devil Down Below' really is the victim of a vast injustice, well, what an adventure it would be to save her!
 - **Skamos:** Sumi likes Skamos as a kindly old man, and is determined not to let any more harm come to him from this whole affair. She's delighted to hear he plays the fiddle, and hopes he can come play at her village some time.
 - **Alacrity:** Sumi thinks she's cute, but has little idea what the 'trade' entails. She respects what Skamos says Alacrity and Hexakhir are doing in trying to get the artefact out of devils' hands.
 - **Marat:** Sumi is horrified by Marat's ruthless disregard for the lives of others, but still sees him as a tragic figure, and respects that he at least tried to offer terms. She holds on to hope that he might one day escape from his circumstances and redeem himself and tries to ignore the voice telling her that is naive.
 - **Hexakhir:** Sumi's admiration for Hexakhir has only grown since learning Khir had a pact with the Leviathan. She's immensely curious to learn more of the dashing captain's adventures.
 - **Idunn:** Sumi's concerned at the way Idunn prepared to attack her when she revealed the Black Spot, but she hopes to win her over.
 - **Tarkus:** He seems OK?
 - **Moti:** Young orc girl who's succeeded Sumi in caring for the shrine. Sumi is very fond of her and hopes she'll inspire her to adventure herself one day.
 - **Nyx:** _GOOD DOG. BEST FRIEND._
 - **Yolotli:** Superb friend noodle.
 - **Gorta:** Sumi thinks Gorta is absolutely amazing and is extremely glad she could help Freya reunite with her.
 - **The Lindworm:** Sumi went out on a limb to get the Lindworm's side of the story, and was disgusted with its petty cruelty and selfishness. She's increasingly doubting her inclination to give people the benefit of the doubt, and seek diplomacy before fighting.
 - **The Jarl:** Sumi is appalled that the Jarl would sell out his people to a dragon's selfish whims, and quietly hopes his subjects will see fit to overthrow him.
 - **Finnegan:** Over the course of their exploration of Melf's Tower of Flame, Sumi has warmed up to Finnegan and come to respect his eccentricities. She wants to hear all his stories of history.
 - **Vengeance:** Sumi is not ignorant of this guy's suspicious looks, and she wants to prove to him that Leviathan's gifts are not a curse but something with which she can do good.
 - **Nystul's Shadow:** Sumi's heart went out to the simulacrum bound to her duty in the tower, her great loss, and the feeling of seeing the world go bye. She wants to get closer to the ancient wizard, and show her that she's still part of this world even as much as it's changed, that she can have a life beyond the task she was assigned.

## Invocations
<!--### Thief of Five Fates
You can cast _bane_ once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.-->

### Eyes of the Rune Keeper
You can read all writing.

### Gaze of Two Minds
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

### Thirsting Blade
You can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Spells known
### Cantrips

{% capture minorillusion %}
*Illusion cantrip* \\
**Casting Time:** 1 action \\
**Range:** 30 feet \\
**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece) \\
**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

 - You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

## Features
### Class features
{% capture callofthedeep %}
You can breathe underwater and you have a swimming speed of 20 feet. Additionally, when immersed in water, your warlock spells no longer require verbal components.
{% endcapture %}

{% include hidden.html content=callofthedeep id="callofthedeep" title="Call of the Deep" %}

{% capture pactoftheblade %}
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
{% endcapture %}
