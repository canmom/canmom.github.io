## Description
### Brief background
Sumi lived among a typical community of hardworking gay orcs in a clifftop village, dreaming of the Ancestors, flirting with other orc girls and dutifully attending to the small circle of stones. But after a spirit started causing trouble, she volunteered to deal with it - and a tense moment, discovered abilities she'd never imagined she'd had, and with them, manifested the Black Spot.

Which was kind of alarming.

Neither Sumi nor anyone else in the village had any idea what to make of these powers, but they recognised them as a curse. They pooled resources to send Sumi out to find out what had cursed her.

### Ideal
To live a bold, ingenious, romantic life like Grim, but also embody wisdom, care, and devotion like Seritha.

Sumi believes the way she approaches her struggles reveals her heart to the world - and she wishes to show a bold and kind heart.

### Bonds
 - **Ariel:** Sumi is kind of in awe of Ariel's knowledge of the world and skill, and a little intimidated by her. After Ariel revealed how worried she was about Sumi's curse, Sumi vowed to own her powers, be true in their expression, and never again let herself hide or lose control. Sumi does not want to hurt or scare her friends any more. Also Ariel shot Marat when he refused to listen to her; it was badass but Sumi is even more intimidated!
 - **Freya:** Freya was there when Sumi was born, and has known her all her life. She was the first person Sumi went to after discovering her curse. Sumi and Freya fought back to back during the lighthouse siege, and Sumi has hella respect for her. She is eager to reunite Freya and Gorta, and wants to provide all the support she can to Freya in the meantime.
 - **Minerva:** Minerva lived near Sumi's village, and she and Sumi set out on their journey together. Sumi has taken her out dancing, but Minerva was a bit of a wallflower. Sumi knows Minerva doesn't always like to talk, but she wishes she could understand her better.
 - **Striven:** Sumi has been asking Striven for understanding of the Black Spot, and she's kind of attracted to her and thinks her magic is pretty fantastic. Sumi is trying to work out what would be a good tattoo to ask Striven to draw on her.
 - **Leviathan:** Sumi has been afraid of Leviathan, but she's determined to face her fear, learn what Leviathan wants, and do the best she can with these circumstances. She was very surprised to find Leviathan so amiable when meeting face to face. She's still suspicious that Leviathan may be telling her what she wants to hear, but she wants to give her a fair shake, and if the 'Devil Down Below' really is the victim of a vast injustice, well, what an adventure it would be to save her!
 - **Skamos:** Sumi likes Skamos as a kindly old man, and is determined not to let any more harm come to him from this whole affair. She's delighted to hear he plays the fiddle, and hopes he can come play at her village some time.
 - **Alacrity:** Sumi thinks she's cute, but has little idea what the 'trade' entails. She respects what Skamos says Alacrity and Hexakhir are doing in trying to get the artefact out of devils' hands.
 - **Marat:** Sumi is horrified by Marat's ruthless disregard for the lives of others, but still sees him as a tragic figure, and respects that he at least tried to offer terms. She holds on to hope that he might one day escape from his circumstances and redeem himself and tries to ignore the voice telling her that is naive.
 - **Hexakhir:** Sumi knows her only by reputation so far, but her immediate impression is that this here is exactly what a very attractive sea captain looks like.

### Personality traits

## Invocations
### Armour of Shadows
You can cast mage armour on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

{% capture magearmour %}
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends it if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
{% endcapture %}

{% include hidden.html content=magearmour id="magearmour" title="Mage Armour" %}

### Gaze of Two Minds
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

## Spells known
### Cantrips

{% capture minorillusion %}
*Illusion cantrip* \\
**Casting Time:** 1 action \\
**Range:** 30 feet \\
**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece) \\
**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
{% endcapture %}
{% include hidden.html content=minorillusion id="minorillusion" title="Minor Illusion" %}

{% capture thunderclap %}
*Evocation cantrip* \\
**Casting Time:** 1 action \\
**Range:** 5 feet \\
**Components:** S \\
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage.
{% endcapture %}
{% include hidden.html content=thunderclap id="thunderclap" title="Thunderclap" %}

### 1st level spells
{% capture dissonantwhispers %}
*1st-level enchantment* \\
**Casting Time:** 1 action \\
**Range:** 60 feet \\
**Components:** V \\
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

*At Higher Levels:* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
{% endcapture %}

{% include hidden.html content=dissonantwhispers id="dissonantwhispers" title="Dissonant Whispers" %}

{% capture invisibility %}
*2nd-level illusion*\\
**Casting Time:** 1 action\\
**Range:** Touch\\
**Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)\\
**Duration:** Concentration, 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

*At Higher Levels:* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
{% endcapture %}

{% include hidden.html content=invisibility id="invisibility" title="Invisibility" %}

{% capture armsofhadar %}
*1st-level conjuration*\\
**Casting Time:** 1 action\\
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)\\
**Components:** V, S\\
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You invoke the power of Hadar, the Dark Hunger. Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and can't take reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.

*At Higher Levels:* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
{% endcapture %}

{% include hidden.html content=armsofhadar id="armsofhadar" title="Arms of Hadar" %}

{% capture armorofagathys %}
*1st-level abjuration*\\
**Casting Time:** 1 action\\
**Range:** Self\\
**Components:** V, S, M (a cup of water)\\
**Duration:** 1 hour

A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

*At Higher Levels:* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.
{% endcapture %}

## Features
### Class features
{% capture callofthedeep %}
You can breathe underwater and you have a swimming speed of 20 feet. Additionally, when immersed in water, your warlock spells no longer require verbal components.
{% endcapture %}

{% include hidden.html content=callofthedeep id="callofthedeep" title="Call of the Deep" %}

**Pact of the Blade**
{% capture pactoftheblade %}
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
