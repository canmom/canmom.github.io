And now, my friends, and now… the witching hour is soon to be upon us once more, and it is time we revelled in the darkness and terror, for tonight is <em>hallow'een</em>, easily the best festival in the western calendar.

Many thanks go to <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/MEa7OkSTM5NNmXdTqXGifjg">@glitch-critter</a> and <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/MjKTH9-XB2oRuIApB5hjLYA">@muzothecat</a>, who provided me some excellent suggestions for animated horror that I have yet to see. Not that reruns would be the end of the world, there’s some excellent shit on the list above I would be immensely glad to see again.

To begin with, we have the recently-released <strong>The Birth of Kitarō: The Mystery of GeGeGe</strong> (幾多郎誕生：ゲゲゲの謎). Which provides an excellent excuse to get into the subject of Kitarou. So let’s begin our dark and sordid tale… <small>well, it’s actually a pretty positive tale, but that’s not really in the spirit of things.</small>

<cite>GeGeGe no Kitarō</cite> is a truly classic manga series dating back to the 60s, created by Shigeru Mizuki. But it’s actually older still: the earliest incarnation of Kitarō is in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamishibai">kamishibai</a> performance written/illus. by Masami Itō and Keiyō Tatsumi back in 1933, called <cite>Hakaba Kitarō</cite> (Kitarō of the Graveyard). It tells the story of a ghost boy called Kitarō who lives in a graveyard; like many kamishibai it was aiming at straight up horror. Here’s a board from the original (photo by translator <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackDavisson/status/578588010461151233/photo/1">Zack Davisson</a>, thanks wikipedia):

So, you know yōkai? You’re reading <em>this</em> blog, so probably, but just in case, they are the various freaky spirits of Japanese folklore, from kappa and tengu to nekomata and chōchin-oiwa. And the reason why they are such a popular feature of modern popular culture (you all know what a kappa is, right?) is in large part due to this manga.

Shigeru Mizuki, born 1922, had <a href="https://gegegenokitaro.fandom.com/wiki/Shigeru_Mizuki#Timeline">a pretty wild life</a>. He was drafted into the army in 1943 at age 21, and lost his left arm in a bombing the next year; during his recovery he made friends among the Tolai people of New Guinea. He came home after the war, and found work renting out an apartment building and drawing kamishibai on the side; gradually the kamishibai work took over. In 1953, his brother Sōhei moved in after being tried for war crimes (the timeline does not mention the outcome of the trial); in 1957 at age 35 he moved to drawing manga, debuting in rental manga with <cite>Rocketman</cite>.

Starting in 1960 at the behest of Mizuki’s publisher, the <cite>Hakaba Kitarō</cite> manga adapted the story of the yamishibai, introducing a wider audience to ghost boy Kitarō with his floofy hair and little third eye on a stalk. It proved <em>explosively</em> popular (despite being at first deemed too scary for children), telling the stories of Kitarō’s encounters with all kinds of yōkai. The state of English translations is a bit scattershot; some of it is available on mangadex.

In 1964, at age 42, Mizuki debuted in serialised manga in <cite>Garo</cite> magazine - a name you might find familiar, the avant-garde magazine which also published authors like Suehiro Maruo (ero-guro mangaka, the author of <cite>Shoujo Tsubaki</cite>) and Hiroshi Masamura (the guy who made the cat manga we looked into on <a href="https://canmom.tumblr.com/post/761108997792235520/i-will-write-more-on-these-films-tomorrow-but">AN188</a>). There, he rebooted the Kitarō manga, starting once again with the story of the birth of Kitarō. Before long he jumped over to the much larger <cite>Monthly Shonen Magazine</cite>, and retooled Kitarō to be more kid-oriented. From then on it’s Kitarō city - and the immense success of the manga gave him the chance to regularly return to the newly combined state of Papua New Guinea.

In 1968, Kitarō arrived in animation land, one of Toei’s early projects. It quickly became one of those classic famous Toei anime, you know the type, the kind of thing that every Japanese person of a certain age would have seen on TV. Mizuki himself composed the OP, and it continued to get sequels throughout the ensuing fifty years, with the most recent being in 2018. This is an old and widely beloved anime so there is a lot of it: the 1968 series accumulated 65 episodes, the third series in 1985-88 is the longest at 115, but the others are no slouch either; even the 2018 series pulled out a mighty 97.

As such, it’s… perhaps a little daunting! But…

<cite>The Birth of Kitarō</cite> is a prequel to the 2018 series… and rather than being a spooky-fun kids anime, it’s intended as a genuine horror story aimed at adults, presumably adults who grew up watching Kitarō, returning to the earliest <cite>Garo</cite>-era tone of the manga. Set in the 50s, the story sees salaryman Mizuki arrive in a village in pursuit of a mysterious medicine, where he finds the village ruled by an old superstitious family. Naturally, before long, murders start happening. And a mysterious white-haired man is somehow involved…

Seems like the perfect way to get into Kitarō. I missed the chance to see this film at Annecy this year, but it’s already out on nyaa, so let’s jump on it.

So that’s our first act. What of our second?

<strong><cite>Junk Head</cite></strong> is a stop-motion scifi film pretty much enitrely solo animated by Takehide Hori who, at age 40, heard about Makoto Shinkai’s solo-animated film <cite>Voices of a Distant Star</cite> (<a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/44-makoto-shinkai">AN44</a>), and was inspired to spend the next seven years working on a stop-motion scifi epic of his own. It tells of a cyborg from a future where humans have lost the ability to reproduce, venturing into a strange underground realm full of freaky creatures that, I’m told, invite comparisons to the art of Giger, Bosch, Escher and Gorey, and the films of Švankmajer (whose <cite>Alice</cite> we watched on <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/50-stop-motion">AN50</a>), Gilliam, and the Quay Brothers. del Toro lauded it as a 'work of deranged brilliance’.

Which is to say this is <em>exactly</em> the kind of thing we like to show here on Animation Night. I can’t believe I didn’t hear of this film before. Sources are not exactly abundant, but I was able to find a hardsubbed 720p version with a few seeds on it, so that’s what we’ll be watching tonight.

Speaking of the Brothers Quay, who enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Quay#Style">a remarkably in-depth and thorough wiki page</a>, they have yet to appear on Animation Night, and it’s about time we remedied that! A pair of identical twins from the Pennsylvania who moved to the UK in 1969 to study at the RCA, they got their start in illustration before making a turn to stop motion film using bits of dolls and various other materials in the vein of Švankmajer.

They are incredibly prolific as a pair, making shorts in nearly every year from 1979 to 2021 (bar a couple of hiatuses). Most of their films are without dialogue, set instead to the music of Leszek Jankowski and a great many other other composers. They are huge book nerds too, adapting authors from Lem and Kafka to Emma Hauck; honestly there’s a ton to dive into here and I will for sure be returning to these guys on a future Animation Night. Tonight, however, our pick will be <strong><cite>Street of Crocodiles</cite></strong> (2021), a musical piece in which a puppet walks through a desolate realm of “mechanical realities and manufactured pleasures”, widely celebrated as one of their best films.

Stop motion seems to be a theme tonight, huh? Somehow, stop motion is just spookier than traditional animation. That theme continues with <cite><strong>The House</strong></cite>, an anthology piece for Netflix depicting three different stories taking place in the same house. Animated in London, each piece brings in a different director, respectively Emme de Swaef and Marc James Roels co-directing the first, Swedish director Niki Lindroth von Bahr the second and Mexican-British actress turned director Paloma Baeza for the third.

The stories span a few hundred years, from the 1800s to a flooded post climate change future. In each case, the house is the stage for tales of obsession and misguided ambition leading to disaster, whether it should befall anthro rats, humans or anthro cats. Widely praised for its animation and general weirdness, I’m quite excited to see what this mix has in store.

And returning of course will be <strong><cite>Yamishibai</cite></strong>, the wonderful long-running series of ridiculous cutout-animated creepypasta horror in the vein of old-school kamishibai boards. You know we gotta. And hey, if we’re feeling in a really good mood at the end of the evening, I might bring <cite>Shoujo Tsubaki</cite> out of the vaults too. We shall see.

<strong>Animation Night 193</strong> shall begin, with its gruesome course of animated horrors, at <strong>seventh hour….</strong> which is to say 7pm UK time, just over four hours from the writing of this post. Be there, or be forever haunted by the ghosts of frames unseen (unless you gotta go trick or treat or something, we understand). The place? Upon the heath… of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/canmom"><small>twitch.tv/</small><strong>canmom</strong></a>!

Hoooohhooohohoohooohooohohoooooooooo!
