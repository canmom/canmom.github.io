excerpt: Yasuhiro Yoshiura is almost a chameleon director - each of his works seems to perfectly reflect its era. A robot café and a world where some people fall upwards await...

<p>…oh dear, I seem to have been inverted! Hope that doesn’t get me in trouble with a fascist society of people whose relation to gravity is opposite mine…</p>

<p>Tonight! We’re going to check out director Yasuhiro Yoshiura, best known for the film <cite>Patema Inverted</cite> (サカサマのパテマ, <cite>Sakasama no Patema</cite>)! This is a fun sci-fi romance whose premise is, well, what I just described: Patema is a girl who lives in underground tunnels; she emerges on the surface to find that the floor of her caves was actually the ceiling, and she falls upwards into the sky. Luckily for her, a standard-issue short-haired anime boy is on hand…</p>

<p>I watched <cite>Patema Inverted</cite> a few years ago, and since I didn’t have a lot of time for extensive research tonight, I figured, let’s pick up something I know is decent</p>

<p>We’ve seen some of the work of Yasuhiro Yoshiura before, long ago on animation night during the Japan Animator Expo, where he developed two of the Studio Trigger shorts: <cite>Power Plant No. 33</cite> about the kaiju electric plant, and <cite>Bureau of Proto Society</cite>, where (iirc) a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic bunker attempt to reconstruct the past from movies. So generally speaking he has a pretty fun style!</p>

<p>It is surprisingly hard to find detailed information about Yoshiura. I found one <a href="https://frogkun.com/2015/02/08/patema-inverted-a-matter-of-perspective/">fairly extended review of Patema</a> by an Anime News Network writer which throws out a few details, such as that he’s known for being connected to the indie animator scene… and honestly that’s about it! All I have is a brief bio and a filmography, so let’s see what we can reconstruct…</p>

<p>Yoshiura got his start making short films and OVAs, such as <cite>Aquatic Language</cite> (2002) and <cite>Pale Cocoon</cite> (2006), working with what seems to be a relatively small team called Studio Rikka. Compared to his later fims, these tended to lean much more into an angular indie style:</p>

</figure>

<p>They were pretty overt in their messages: <cite>Aquatic Language</cite> sees characters directly discussing the importance of language, while <cite>Pale Cocoon</cite> sees - much like his later <cite>Bureau</cite> - apocalypse survivors poring over the cultural records of the past.</p>

<p>These films both proved pretty successful, and in 2008-9 Yoshiura made something a bit bigger: a net animation series called <cite>Time of Eve</cite>, which was a collection of slice of life vignettes about a pro-robot café. Such a tropey premise as ‘robots suffer discrimination’ sounds like it could be rather hit or miss, but the execution is widely praised so let’s give it a shot!</p>

<p>Around the same time, Yoshiura got pulled into the orbit of the Eva rebuilds at Khara, providing design work for the second film. For a few years after 2.0 came out, he must have been working on Patema; afterwards, we see his work at the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Animator_Training_Project">Young Animator Training Project</a> in 2013 (a Japanese government initiative to make short films at various anime studios), producing a short film called <cite>Harmonie</cite> (a romance based on mutual enthusiasm for music is the gist I am getting from summaries). From there, we hit the Animator Expo, a <cite>Patlabor</cite> reboot, and an upcoming film <cite>Sing a Bit of Harmony</cite> due to release this year.</p>

<p>So, what’s his interest as a filmmaker, what are the <em>theeeemes</em>? Just about all his movies make a pretty overt reference to communication and connection; much like Mamoru Hosoda, he’s been eagerly exploring his pet theme through a variety of different sci-fi devices. But he’s got a few other recurring motifs: underground living, reconstructing the past through archives, café settings. Visually, his later films tend to fall into the broad space of summer movies (despite Patema actually being a November release), with lush paintings of clouds and that one short-haired boy who gets everywhere; but they can also be quite impactful, particularly the&nbsp;‘falling upwards’ scenes early in <cite>Patema</cite>.</p>

<p>Honestly? I don’t expect any of these movies to be particularly challenging, but I think I need something light and fun tonight, and these should definitely hit the spot! Looking forward to finding out which ones stand out…</p>
