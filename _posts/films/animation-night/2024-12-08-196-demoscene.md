Hey everyone! It’s gonna be a short post today, because the hour is late, but I’ve been teasing this all week, soooooo~

This is a square-numbered animation night, our first in a while, and that means it’s a night for something computer-related. And what is more true to the essence of computer animation than the demoscene?

And damn, what a topic. ‘Computer art subculture’ is the usual way of describing it, and that’s accurate enough. But let’s get into details…

A <strong>demo</strong> is a computer program which is kind of like a non-interactive game, and kind of like a music video. It generates images, usually synced to music, in realtime. But that doesn’t quite get to the heart of it.

A demo is kind of a combination of art piece and coding challenge. The exact constraints vary: perhaps the whole program fits into a tiny size (such as 4kb). Or, it’s made for a specific oldschool computer, such as the Amiga, taking advantage of the unique quirks of the hardware to push its graphics capabilities to the absolute limit.

Perhaps it’s better to start with the history - a well-covered subject in books, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/who-killed-the-american-demoscene-synchrony-demoparty/">articles</a> and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB80155C0CA46465B">documentaries</a>, which I will have to cover <em>extremely briefly</em>. Back in the late 70s and 80s, when personal computing was really taking off with machines like the Commodore 64, copyright took a while to catch up - particularly in Europe. With network bandwidth far more limited than now, it became popular (relatively speaking) to distribute cracked software at events known as 'copy parties’ - you’d bring along your files and exchange them for others.

Often, the groups who created the cracks would add a little intro to take credit for their hard work. With space at an absolute premium, these 'intros’ would need to be <em>tiny</em> - perhaps just hundreds of bytes. But constraints breed creativity, and soon groups would compete to distinguish themselves with the most impressive intros. Perhaps you see where this is going…

I’m going to brush over a long and fascinating history here, because space is limited and I would rather try and dig into the history another time - I’m hardly the person to tell it, anyway. So let’s just say this: the practice of making these intros, or more generally demos, very quickly grew into its own art form - if you didn’t have cracked software you could just bring along a cool intro to the copy party. And as copyright law heated up and the cops started coming for copyparties, the nascent demoscene started to diverge from the warez scene, developing into its own, unique subculture - legal but still indebted to the hacker culture which birthed it.

Broadly speaking, the demoscene is organised around <strong><dfn>demoparties</dfn></strong> - big gatherings, largely taking place around Europe, where groups gather to enter their demos into competition, create new demos right there, and engage in related activities like live coding… or dorky shit like throwing keyboards as far as possible, don’t ask me about that one. It’s not all about creating demos either - over time, the categories have expanded to include music, digital art in general, 3D asset creation, etc. etc., unified more by the aesthetic of the scene than anything. Take a look at <a href="https://files.scene.org/browse/parties/2024/revision24/">the entries for a party like Revision</a> (the largest party, based in Germany, hosting about 800 guests each year) to get a sense of the broad scope of the scene.

But the core of it all is still demos! 4k, 8k, 64k, unlimited in size. PC, amiga. Demos have evolved a great deal over the decades, and it is hard to generalise too much. Still, in contrast to game graphics, which usually emphasise authored content, efficient streaming of assets etc. etc., the emphasis of the demoscene tends to be much more on procedural effects and more abstract visuals.

You can get a taste for what a winning demo looked like as of 2007 with <a href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=30244"><cite>debris.</cite></a> by the group Farbrausch, pouet.net’s top-rated demo of all time: techno music, a camera flying over a cityscape as cubes stream around…

And here’s one of the most popular 4kb demos, rendering a procedural snowy landscape with a bit of chromatic aberration to taste…

Modern PC demos have introduced tools like the node-based animation and sim software <a href="https://www.notch.one/">Notch</a>, which shifts the emphasis away from programming a bit. <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdUDGo2Gxw">Rainmaker</a></cite>, which won Revision’s PC demo category this year, hardly attempts to optimise for file size, with its executable weighing in at a hefty half a gigabyte, but it certainly goes all out with all that data, hitting flashy scene after flashy scene…

Even in the space-contained categories like 64k and 4k, you can see a modern approach to HDR colour, grading, depth of field etc.:

Especially for the smaller categories of demo, the music tends to be procedurally generated - i.e., chiptunes - as well. But even without that constraint, there is a natural tendency towards many types of electronic music in the scene. After all, it’s all about making computers do cool shit.

And to be clear, although technical flexing and generative art is definitely a big part of it, there’s plenty of familiar animation stuff in here too. Successful demos tend to feature tight music sync, creative imagery, and definitely some kind of progression or flow in how the images are juxtaposed and how they fit the development of the music. If you felt really pretentious, you could compare it to poetry. <small>I do feel really pretentious, so I will!</small>

Where do you find demos? Unfortunately, there are now many dead links. <a href="https://www.pouet.net/">pouet.net</a> is still something of a hub, featuring a pretty exhaustive database of demos and a voting system to sort them by popularity, as well as providing a forum for the scene (hopefully not about to disappear as its main admin just announced his plans to quit). <a href="https://www.demoscene.info/">Demoscene.info</a> tries to be a decent public-facing intro, with links to the major parties and groups that still <em>mostly</em> work. The <a href="https://awards.scene.org/">scene.org awards</a> celebrated a set of demos each year from 2002 to 2011. Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxyPjW-DeNVnrA1TDZ_S7IG3PS9UE-yo">psenough</a> reports weekly on what’s happening in the scene. There’s also <a href="https://demozoo.org/">Demozoo</a>, a database similar to pouet---less socially oriented, but more thorough in its database coverage.

We might also here mention the website <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a>, likely familiar to any graphics programmer, which was co-created by oldschool scener Inigo Quilez and carries much of the same spirit. Shadertoy lets you write fragment shaders in opengl to run in the browser, essentially a type of demo, and people use it for all sorts of shit.

So, that’s a brief summary. Tonight, starting in just a minute, if you’d like to join me at <small><strong><a href="https://twitch.tv/canmom">twitch.tv/</a></strong></small><strong><a href="https://twitch.tv/canmom">canmom</a></strong>, we’ll be checking out a random cross-section of popular demos from across the last few decades. I’ll be running them on my computer, if possible. I fully admit to being an outsider to the scene, yet to go to a demoparty and see it all in person, but I think it’s cool as shit, so let’s go explore it together for a couple of hours~
