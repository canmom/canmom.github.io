It's been a while, hasn't it?

To new readers---welcome to Animation Night. This is a weekly film night in which we watch animated films, and it's also my excuse to write about them.

Tonight I am bringing back one of my favourite films from the Annecy festival last year, <cite>The First Slam Dunk</cite>! I was [pretty blown away](https://canmom.tumblr.com/post/720137394894077952/laventur-de-canmom-%C3%A0-annecy-mercredi-3-the) at the time, and that has not changed with two weeks spent fansubbing the movie.

So what is this movie? The short version is that <cite>The First Slam Dunk</cite> is the best sports movie I’ve ever seen.

A slightly longer version: this movie depicts an incredibly intense, sharply choreographed game of basketball---intercut with the story of our boy Ryota, who struggles to live up to the shadow of his dead brother Sota, not helped by the fact that his mother is *not* dealing with it well. Growing up a taciturn outcast, Ryota finds solace in basketball---though laden with memories of his brother, he finds a new purpose as he and his comrades in the no-name Shohoku basketball team work their way to unexpected success. Now, he stands to achieve Sota’s dream - to beat the as-yet undefeated Sannoh team. But the Sannoh boys want that win just as badly, and they *live* for basketball.

After seeing this movie you’ll get why.

So, a little context...

[<cite>Slam Dunk</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_Dunk_(manga)) by [Takehiko Inoue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takehiko_Inoue) is a wildly popular and long-running sports manga, previously adapted to anime by Toei in the 90s. The original story followed delinquent yankii goofball Sakuragi, who finds a new life in basketball. It drew pretty overtly from Inoue's own balling experience, weaving comedy with tense basketball matches that draw on a real knowledge of the game. This is a very grounded view of basketball: none of the special powers or laser eyes of [<cite>Kuroko no Basket</cite>](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/162829), because as sick as that is, <cite>Slam Dunk</cite> knows that it doesn't need it. Presented in the right way, the tactics and shifts of emotion in a close basketball game *drip* with narrative tension.

But don't think you need to know about basketball to enjoy this movie. Because it's the *animation* that sells it. This is a movie that's about *movement*, building on the techniques of manga panelling---speed lines, extreme perspective shots, rapid camera moves---with fantastic CG animation, drawing on mocap but still moving with the clarity of animation. You know what's important because the camera knows what's important. This movie is an absolute *masterclass* in cinematography and timing. When a clever sideways pass whips out in a direction you don't expect, you know it. Discussions of tactics are woven artfully into the beats of character interaction, comedy, dramatic flashback. You will see what happens and you'll know what it means and it will look insanely cool.

The genesis of this film [saw](https://www.slamdunk-movie-courtside.jp/interview) Toei producer Toshiyuki Matsui pushing for most of the 2000s to make a new <cite>Slam Dunk</cite> movie to follow Toei's original anime adaptation of the 90s. Inoue proved a difficult man to convince, rejecting multiple proposals, including one prototype which cost about as much as a whole movie---but Matsui and his team of CG artists kept developing it, deciding eventually on an approach combining 3DCG and 2D animation. Finally in 2014, Inoue decided it was time to go. At this point, Matsui asked him to write the script and direct, as the expert on <cite>Slam Dunk</cite> and its characters.

A mangaka going into movie direction is not unprecedented---many of the most interesting directors in anime started as mangaka, from Tezuka through Ōtomo to Kon---but it is quite a step to go from one medium to another. And yet you would not believe Inoue hadn't worked in film before. His script cooked for about three years from 2015 to 2018, then mocap and modelling commenced, all in secret---with the first word to the outside world being a sudden Twitter announcement from Inoue that there would be a movie.

And though Toei's 2D/3D pipeline was already set up when Inoue joined the project, Inoue was a very hands-on director, seeking to make sure that---in a rather alchemical turn of phrase---blood would be injected into the characters through extensive drawings and corrections. It helps, of course, that Inoue---also known for <cite>Vagabond</cite>---is one of those all-time drawing god mangaka, but the film also applies a great deal of inventiveness in moving from manga to screen: a unique watercolour-like shader, subtle but effective digital linework, and really brilliant use of speed lines, drops of sweat and other panelling tricks.

The movie, in short, feels like Inoue's manga in motion. It's no mean feat.

<cite>The First Slam Dunk</cite> aims to open the <cite>Slam Dunk</cite> to a new audience - it retells the story from a different perspective, changing the emotional beats as it moves our view from goofy Sakuragi to troubled Ryota.

In short it's a good-ass movie. And that's not to even get into the strength of the emotional arcs, how they weave together; the ingenious ratcheting of tension, the absolutely *killer* soundtrack. Maybe after this screening I'll write a little more.

For this reason, I'm doing something new for Animation Night, and tonight [bringing you my very own fansub](https://nyaa.si/view/1791026). This is building on the work of many people: MTBB made a good clean encode which handled the rather fiddly issue of converting the movie's fake HDR into SDR, blowing my own efforts out of the water; [Strawberino](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealSlamDunk/comments/1b9v64a/made_english_fansubs_for_the_first_slam_dunk_movie/) wrote a new English translation, improving on issues in the theatrical sub; Animorphs helped me with typesetting and many other people on the [Good Job Media](https://www.goodjobmedia.com/) discord helped with various problems I had, and directed me to [resources on fansubbing best practices](https://tilde.club/~garret/fansub.html). I used a lot of tools and scripts from the community including [arch1t3cht's Aegisub fork](https://github.com/arch1t3cht/Aegisub), [Aegisub Motion](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/Aegisub-Motion), and the Blender PowerPin export script. You can read more technical details on the Nyaa page.

All right, that's all for now, see you here after the movie!
