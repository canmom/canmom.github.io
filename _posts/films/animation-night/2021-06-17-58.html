<p>…is something I would be, on consideration, <em>unwise</em> to talk about in the open on Tumblr. (Maybe you saw the post from ten minutes ago. If not, use your imagination. <strike>No it’s not hentai night yet. That’s gotta be Animation Night 69. Am I joking? I’m still not sure.</strike>)</p>

<p>Suffice to say: we will watch a lot of short films. I have disabled VODs so this broadcast is your only chance to watch it. Think of it as me saying, “hey, come over here and watch this” while pointing at my computer. That’s all I think I wanna say. If that sounds enticing, drop by Twitch in half an hour. If that sounds too little to go on - sorry!</p>
