<p>Animation Night tonight is gonna be a cross-section of the <em>Lupin III</em> franchise, v helpfully researched by my friend Elaine! Unfortunately I have messed myself up a bit by being off my meds so I have not been able to write the kind of post Iâ€™d want to on the history of Lupin.</p>

<p>At this point I think Iâ€™m going to have to resort to, Animation Night will still be going ahead at <strong>7pm UK time on twitch.tv/canmom</strong>, and Iâ€™ll write my post sometime later! Hate to do this and donâ€™t want to make a habit of it, but themâ€™s the breaks this week.</p>

<p>Plan is to watch Miyazakiâ€™s <em><strong>The Castle of Cagliostro</strong></em>, and Takeshi Koikeâ€™s recent <em><strong>The Blood Spray of Goemon Ishikawa</strong></em> (a sequel to Sayo Yamamotoâ€™s <em><strong>Woman Called Fujiko Mine</strong></em> series we watched last week, which we may watch some more of), and if I can get them down in time, one of the films from the 80s or 90s like <em><strong>The Fuma Conspiracy</strong></em> or <em><strong>Island of Assassins</strong></em>. Hope to see you there anyway ðŸ˜Œ</p>
