You know where they’re good at animating shit? Well yeah, Japan. And also? China? No argument there, but OK, but what about– yeah, they’re pretty damn good in South Korea, too, holding up the whole world industry, I get that. But hold on, I wanna talk about– yeah, all right, I’ll give the yanks their due—

FRANCE OKAY

Tonight Animation Night returns to the lands we visited on <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/11-french-animation">AN11</a>, <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/32-french-magical-realism">AN32</a>, <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/93-rene-laloux">AN93</a>, <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/114-joann-sfar">AN114</a>, <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/126-back-to-france">AN126</a>, <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/135-short-film-night-rides-again">AN135</a>, and <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/184-mars-express">AN184</a>, and quite possibly others I forgot to tag in <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/">the archive</a>. We’ll be visiting a film I was planning to watch two weeks ago, called <em>Calamity</em>, which adopts a very unusual lineless animation style to tell the story of how the famous gun-shooting lady Calamity Jane got her start in the Old West.

No long dry history of Westerns this time, let’s just cut to the chase. I bought this BD in Annecy because it won the Cristal a few years ago. It looks pretty lovely visually! Hopefully you’ll agree!

Along with this, we have the latest fruits of the Gobelins animation school! We’ve already checked out a couple of this year’s crop, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayE46o9VP2Y"><strong><em>Layla</em></strong></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6MIQMaJT7M"><strong><em>Wormwood</em></strong></a>, and they were pretty damn special, but there’s been a bunch of releases since then in all kinds of gorgeous, unique styles! Films such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx0OaDkR7HA"><strong><em>The Story of Three Sisters</em></strong></a> (painterly mythological tone), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHK0J1Ae70E"><strong><em>How To Make A Friend</em></strong></a> (sweet robot story that looks like an Amanita Design game), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJqeYG0hYs"><strong><em>Catfish</em></strong></a> (girl menaced by memories of her old house), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjhuBEE--48"><strong><em>Ambush</em></strong></a> (astronauts!). At this point I’ve probably written enough paeans to the Gobelins school - you probably know the deal, and if you don’t, I’m sure you will after tonight.

I don’t have much more to say than that, let’s keep it short and get to the films! Going live shortly at <strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/canmom"><small>twitch.tv/</small></a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/canmom">canmom</a></strong>! Hopefully returning to Thursdays will work for everyone…
