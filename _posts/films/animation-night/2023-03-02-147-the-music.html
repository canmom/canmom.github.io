<p>Old hands at Animation Night may recall the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLldXXM8QsTgiIABSRbZdE8LIbKO-P9IUj">two big playlists</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCYazl_szpb5f40oa1-xIOyTx_V5V6ZMe">of animated music videos</a> we used to draw from at the end of every night! Compiled by the indomitable <a href="https://tmblr.co/MuGohQC0iiFlCNPF5Pat2Iw">@mogsk</a>‚Äã and <a href="https://twitter.com/scattermoon">scattermoon</a>, they took us on a fascinating tour of visual and musical styles. Animation and music are good friends‚Ä¶ at least in short form.</p>

<p>And occasionally, musicians get the idea of doing something a bit grander than a single music video. Like a whole movie. We‚Äôve seen a couple of these before - funnily enough both British - with <cite>The Wall</cite> and <cite>Yellow Submarine</cite> on <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/86-rainy-fascism-island">AN #86</a>. For the other landmarks in this tiny genre, we gotta go to‚Ä¶ Japan!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs roll back to 2003! Anime is just entering its computer era, and household-name electronic music duo Daft Punk have decided that the thing their new album needs is an animated film by Toei, resulting in <strong><cite>Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem</cite></strong>. Or in Japanese, „Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éº„Çπ„ÉÜ„É©5555, <i>IntƒÅsutera F≈ç Faibu</i>, ‚ÄúFour Five‚Äù.</p>

<p>Like <cite>Yellow Submarine</cite>, <cite>Interstella 5555</cite> is largely a frame story to set up the band‚Äôs songs. It tells the story of a pop band of blue aliens kidnapped by a dastardly human aristocrat in a scheme to mind control them and exploit their special musical talent to sell records. A young alien astronaut goes on a mission to stop them and free the band.</p>

<p>The film‚Äôs animation takes after Leiji Matsumoto, the incredibly infuential mangaka and director behind <cite>Space Battleship Yamato</cite>, <cite>Space Captain Harlock,</cite> and <cite>Galaxy Express 999</cite>. Matsumoto is credited on the film as a ‚ÄòSupervisor‚Äô, although I‚Äôm not entirely sure what that means.</p>

<p>I wrote about Leiji Matsumoto last week, so <a href="./146-leiji-matsumoto">you can read about his origins in WWII comics before becoming the creation of the Leijiverse</a>. His works were a big hit in France, where for example <cite>Space Pirate Captain Harlock</cite> came over as <cite>Albator</cite>, and there a young Daft Punk got to meet the galaxy of tragic long women and little bean guys‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚Ä¶and they had enough money in their pockets to make it possible to create a movie-length tribute to Matsumoto, with a style that‚Äôs a deliberate call back. I‚Äôm not sure if Interstella 5555 belongs in the Leijiverse proper, but it definitely hits the style of his designs, not to mention many of the recurring motifs - humanoid aliens, spaceships modelled on unlikely Earth objects, the tragic results of coercive force (in space!)‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen it once before but I was honestly too tired to appreciate it. If you‚Äôve seen <cite>Interstella</cite> before, I hope it will be fun to see it again; if you haven‚Äôt, I hope you‚Äôll join me in witnessing it with fresh eyes!</p>

<p>Alongside that we have <cite>Sound & Fury</cite>! Thanks to <a href="https://tmblr.co/MuGohQC0iiFlCNPF5Pat2Iw">@mogsk</a>‚Äã for investigating this one &lt;3</p>

<p><cite>Sound & Fury</cite> is so far as I can discern a compilation of music videos based on the songs of country musician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgill_Simpson">Sturgill Simpson</a>. However, I know next to nothing about Simpson, and only came across him through music videos excerpted from this film. Here‚Äôs how the music is described‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Breaking with Simpson‚Äôs established country style, it featured a fuzzy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock" title="Hard rock">hard rock</a> sound augmented by extensive use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer" title="Synthesizer">synthesizers</a>, influenced by psychedelia, funk, and electronic rock.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgill_Simpson#cite_note-sing_video-60">[60]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The film as a whole - just forty minutes long - is directed by Junpei Miyazaki of Kamikaze Douga, known for their work on the OPs to David Production‚Äôs Jojo adaptation, and on Pop Team Epic. Kamikaze Douga handled a good chunk of the episodes themselves (in both 2D and 3D), and pulled in other studios for the rest - these include some I‚Äôm not familiar with, like Grayscale Arts. But one name I definitely do recognise, Michael Arias of <cite>Tekkonkinkreet</cite> (<a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/52-year">see AN 52</a>). Arias is an American who went to America to work in anime at 4C; his work on this film seems to be with a much smaller team, actually in live action.</p>

<p>Moreover, two episodes bring in Henry Thurlow and D‚ÄôArt Shtajio, some of whose work I think I showed back on <a href="https://canmom.art/films/animation-night/21-black-american-animation">Animation Night 21</a>. Their selling point is that they‚Äôre the only Black-owned anime studio in Japan, and they‚Äôve previous worked a lot on music videos and short films as well as contributing to various TV sh≈çnen anime. It‚Äôs cool to see these guys again - unfortunately I don‚Äôt think their crowdfunded projects were successful, but I bet what they put will be pretty stylish.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs a brief summary of the credits - but what‚Äôs it actually about? Samurai, post-apocalyptic landscapes, and a lot of aesthetic stuff. I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs really a unifying story as such; in Simpson‚Äôs own words it‚Äôs basically a competition to show off cool shit‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simpson said that while in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, he was inspired after listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem" title="Eminem">Eminem</a> to write ‚Äúa bunch of mad shit-talking songs about how fucking awesome we are‚Äù but later began to think that what he and his band had produced was not ‚Äúweird‚Äù enough, so came up with the idea to travel to Japan and ‚Äúget the five most legendary animation directors in history together and get them all drunk and put them to competition to see who can outdo one another, and we‚Äôll just animate the whole fucking album‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not long after finishing the album and film, he cut ties with his record label, citing burnout and criticising the music industry. Basically ‚Äògood luck selling this guys‚Äô. It seems like kind of a mess so I bet it will be intriguing to take a look into.</p>

<p>So that‚Äôs the subject for tonight! With such a late start I won‚Äôt have a ton of extra time, but I‚Äôd like to revisit some of our favourite animated music videos at the end, so if you‚Äôve got requests, make note of em! We‚Äôll be going live at <a href="https://twitch.tv/canmom"><strong>twitch.tv/canmom</strong></a> now, and starting films in about 20 minutes - would love to see you there!!</p>
