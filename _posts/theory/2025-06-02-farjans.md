The demoscene is steeped in decades of lore, and notoriously a little insular with its many cherished injokes. One expression of that came in the form of Gasman's song <cite>[We Didn't Start the Färjans](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=98429)</cite>, which parodies <cite>We Didn't Start the Fire</cite> with a long list of demoscene allusions.

I am autistic enough to try and find out what they all were, so strap in. Here's the song:

{% include youtube.html id="RNL8pqQ01Qc" %}

Probably goes without saying, but I was not here for most of this---some of these injokes are older than I am. Still, here's my best attempt to unpack them.

## Verse 1

The song is roughly chronological, so the first verse mostly concerns the C64 scene of the late 80s and early 90s, with a little Amiga at the end.

SID chip
: the Sound Interface Device chip notably used on the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), the computer on which the demoscene was born, used to program chiptunes.

Berlin Bear
: a [classic cracktro](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=17555) from the very early demoscene

Floppies at computer fairs
: the demoscene grew out of copyparties, where cracked software would be exchanged on floppy discs. Presumably these were also exchanged at mainstream computer fairs?

Piccolo Mouso
: an early C64 demo from 1983 [depicting a mouse masturbating](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=10458)

parallax stars
: not sure about this one, but [scrolling parallax effects](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Parallax_Scrolling) were one effect widely used on the C64

Tristar
: [demogroup founded in 1990](https://demozoo.org/groups/4008/) with a long history

Finnish Gold
: [demogroup founded in the late 80s](https://demozoo.org/groups/3142/), organised demoparties in Finland

Cracker Journal
: a diskmag for the C64/Amiga that began in 1988

Venlo
: seems to be an event that was understood in retrospect as one of the earliest demoparties, but I can't find much about it

Static Bytes
: [a demogroup in the C64 scene](https://demozoo.org/groups/1736/), founded around 1990

Fairlight
: [a renowned Swedish demogroup and cracker group](https://demozoo.org/groups/239/), beginning in 1987 and active until the present.

Alcatraz bars
: a popular C64 demo effect which created a wiggly line with a wall coming down underneath it, named after the demogroup [Alcatraz](https://demozoo.org/groups/738/). A [thread discussing how it's done](http://ada.untergrund.net/?p=demo&i=913).

World of Commodore
: a [renowned demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2938) from 1982

spheres on a checkerboard
: spheres and checkerboards are easy to render procedurally and thus feature often in early computer graphics, dating back [all the way to 1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KrCh5qD9Ho); the video shows the 1989 Amiga demo [All Around](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1337) by Fairlight, which shows a raytraced sphere reflecting other spheres

Spaceballs
: [demogroup founded in 1988](https://demozoo.org/groups/3/), named after the Mel Brooks film.

Desert Dream
: landmark [Amiga demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1483) from 1993

Letting girls get in for free
: I can't find anything online relating to this, but given how heavily male-skewed the demoscene was and still is demographically, it's possible that some early parties waived the ticket price for women?

Maniacs of Noise
: [demogroup that existed since at least 1988](https://demozoo.org/groups/950/), but not much info on the Demozoo page

atomic playboys
: referring to a sample in the renowned demo [Second Reality](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=63), quoting a memetic phrase [that originated with](https://www.reddit.com/r/Demoscene/comments/g8r4s/origin_of_the_i_am_not_an_atomic_playboy_quote/) US Vice Admiral W.H.R. Blandy speaking about the nuclear bomb tests at Bikini Atoll

CNCD
: [Finnish demogroup](https://demozoo.org/groups/26/) also called Carillon & Cyberiad, dating back to at least 1992

No Copy
: refers to a late-90s controversy over pixel artists creating pixelised versions of other artists' work, often without crediting sources. Referenced artists included Boris Vallejo, Cindy Crawford, and Hajime Surayama. The [No Copy](http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/index.htm) website has many examples of demoscene pixel art and the pieces it references.

Barti
: appears to be a scener, but I can't find out much about them online

Boozembly
: demoparty running since 1995

## Chorus 1

The choruses mostly relate to the Färjan meme.

We Didn't Start The Färjan
: Färjan is the Swedish word for ferries. As a demoscene meme, this seems to date back to a comically low-effort 64k invite called [Finlandsfärjan](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=24131) by Jumalauta, which subsequently inspired [numerous parodies and remixes](https://www.pouet.net/lists.php?which=156). By the time the tool [färjanmaker](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=77751) was made, it seems everyone was in on the joke (almost every comment is a riff on the same meme).

It was always floating while the nerds were coding
: Self explanatory!

We Didn't Start The Färjans
Jumalauta caught 'em in the early autumn
: Pouet says the Finlandsfärjan demo was released in March 2006, so I'm a bit confused by this line...

## Verse 2

This verse takes us into the late 90s.

Ravers in the sleeping hall
: many demoparties set aside a room where people can bring sleeping bags to sleep during the party instead of having to get a hotel. I assume that at some point a bunch of ravers came into the sleeping room and partied there, though I can't find when on a quick search.

Phong shaded metaballs
: [Phong shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading), invented in 1973, is one of the earliest shading techniques in computer graphics, and very easy to code. [Metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) are implicit surfaces created by finding the isosurfaces of 3D fields---you can mesh them to create triangles or render them with raymarching. These are both stereotypical things to see in early computer graphics. The video shows the 1995 demo [Dope](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=37), which boasts onscreen of how many phong-shaded triangles it's displaying.

Contrast
: [an influential DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=72) from 1996

: [a diskmag](https://pain.scene.org/) running since 1994

The video shows [PSG-Wins](https://demozoo.org/productions/13592/) by Prestige.

Mekka and Symposium
: a [demoparty](https://demozoo.org/parties/series/62/) that ran from 1997-2002 in Saxony, Germany

Hyperventilation
: a [1998 DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=309) by the group Byterapers (hell of a name...), notably featuring samples from ABBA

paper aeroplanes
: the video shows a brief clip from [Paper](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=75), which was a classic 1996 64k demo; this apparently inspired people at the Wired party where it was released to [fold and throw paper planes](https://www.mediamolecule.com/blog/article/paper_alexs_64k_demo_from_1996) until someone got one in the eye

Poetry
: a [Windows demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1226) from 2000

303
: a [popular DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=44) from 1997

Dutchies and their colour schemes
: an injoke, referring to demos that overuse the colours orange, red and yellow, associated stereotypically with Dutch sceners. [apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20170509163458/https://tomaes.32x.de/text/faq.php) this joke originates with someone called Macaw on the comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos usenet newsgroup.

Gravenreuth on the attack
: German lawyer Günter Freiherr von Gravenreuth [threatened lawsuits against](https://www.filfre.net/2016/01/a-pirates-life-for-me-part-2-the-scene/) many members of the warez scene, only to be eventually found to be involved in large-scale for-profit piracy himself

Sunflower

Stash and Jizz
: two demos by demogroup The Black Lotus; [Jizz](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2) and [Stash](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3) were both released in 1997 (coincidentally some of the earliest demos to be recorded on Pouet, occupying IDs 2 and 3 in the database)

Blowing up the power grid
: according to scene legend, the power draw of hundreds of computers and CRT monitors at [The Party](https://www.theparty.dk/wiki/The_Party_1997) in 1997 burned through two 25,000 amp fuses and caused a blackout for a portion of the Danish town of [Aars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aars)

: A [popular DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=26) from 1998

real party is outside
: A meme referring to the outdoor gatherings during demoparties where sceners hang out, chat and drink---ironic since it doesn't really involve any of the main demoscene stuff (making demos and looking at them).

## Chorus 2

We Didn't Start The Färjan
It was always floating while the nerds were coding
We Didn't Start The Färjan
But we'll recreate it on a crusty 8-bit
