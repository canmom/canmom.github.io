The demoscene is steeped in decades of lore, and notoriously a little insular with its many cherished injokes. One expression of that came in the form of Gasman's song <cite>[We Didn't Start the Färjans](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=98429)</cite>, which parodies <cite>We Didn't Start the Fire</cite> with a long list of demoscene allusions.

I am autistic enough to try and find out what they all were, so strap in. Here's the song:

{% include youtube.html id="RNL8pqQ01Qc" %}

Probably goes without saying, but I was not here for most of this---some of these injokes are older than I am. Still, here's my best attempt to unpack them.

## Verse 1

The song is roughly chronological, so the first verse mostly concerns the C64 scene of the late 80s and early 90s, with a little Amiga at the end.

SID chip
: the Sound Interface Device chip notably used on the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), the computer on which the demoscene was born, used to program chiptunes.

Berlin Bear
: a [classic cracktro](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=17555) from the very early demoscene

Floppies at computer fairs
: the demoscene grew out of copyparties, where cracked software would be exchanged on floppy discs. Presumably these were also exchanged at mainstream computer fairs?

Piccolo Mouso
: an early C64 demo from 1983 [depicting a mouse masturbating](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=10458)

parallax stars
: not sure about this one, but [scrolling parallax effects](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Parallax_Scrolling) were one effect widely used on the C64

Tristar
: [demogroup founded in 1987](https://demozoo.org/groups/4008/) with a long history

Finnish Gold
: [demogroup founded in the late 80s](https://demozoo.org/groups/3142/), organised demoparties in Finland

Cracker Journal
: a diskmag for the C64/Amiga that began in 1988

Venlo
: [a regular event in the city of Venlo](https://demozoo.org/parties/series/784/) that came to be regarded in retrospect as the birthplace of the demoscene

Static Bytes
: [a demogroup in the C64 scene](https://demozoo.org/groups/1736/), founded around 1990

Fairlight
: [a renowned Swedish demogroup and cracker group](https://demozoo.org/groups/239/), beginning in 1987 and still active

Alcatraz bars
: a popular C64 demo effect which created a wiggly line with a wall coming down underneath it, named after the demogroup [Alcatraz](https://demozoo.org/groups/738/). A [thread discussing how it's done](http://ada.untergrund.net/?p=demo&i=913).

World of Commodore
: a [renowned demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2938) from 1992

spheres on a checkerboard
: spheres and checkerboards are easy to render procedurally and thus feature often in early computer graphics, dating back [all the way to 1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KrCh5qD9Ho); the video shows the 1989 Amiga demo [All Around](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1337) by Fairlight, which shows a raytraced sphere reflecting other spheres

Spaceballs
: [demogroup founded in 1988](https://demozoo.org/groups/3/), named after the Mel Brooks film.

Desert Dream
: landmark [Amiga demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1483) from 1993

Letting girls get in for free
: apparently a common feature for 90s demoparties, due to the heavy demographic skew of the demoscene, and because some sceners wanted to invite their girlfriends.

Maniacs of Noise
: [demogroup that existed since at least 1988](https://demozoo.org/groups/950/), very popular for their music, including works outside the demoscene in games

atomic playboys
: referring to a sample in the renowned demo [Second Reality](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=63), quoting a memetic phrase [that originated with](https://www.reddit.com/r/Demoscene/comments/g8r4s/origin_of_the_i_am_not_an_atomic_playboy_quote/) US Vice Admiral W.H.R. Blandy speaking about the nuclear bomb tests at Bikini Atoll

CNCD
: [Finnish demogroup](https://demozoo.org/groups/26/) also called Carillon & Cyberiad, dating back to at least 1992

No Copy
: refers to a late-90s controversy over pixel artists creating pixelised versions of other artists' work, often without crediting sources. Referenced artists included Boris Vallejo, Cindy Crawford, and Hajime Surayama. The [No Copy](http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/index.htm) website has many examples of demoscene pixel art and the pieces it references.

Barti / Nooon
: a legend DOS coder in the 90s who apparently became somewhat notorious after getting cancer and returning to the demoscene with some inscrutable demos.

Boozembly
: demoparty running since 1995

## Chorus 1

The choruses mostly relate to the Färjan meme.

We Didn't Start The Färjan
: Färjan is the Swedish word for ferries. As a demoscene meme, this dates back to a 64k invite [Finlandsfärjan](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=24131) by Jumalauta, made in a hurry on the ferry from only materials to hand at the time (including a recording of the song <cite>Early Autumn</cite> by Mezzoforte playing on the ferry sound system). This subsequently inspired [numerous parodies and remixes](https://www.pouet.net/lists.php?which=156). By the time the tool [färjanmaker](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=77751) was made, it seems everyone was in on the joke (almost every comment is a riff on the same meme).

It was always floating while the nerds were coding
: Self explanatory!

We Didn't Start The Färjans
Jumalauta caught 'em in the early autumn
: Pouet says the Finlandsfärjan demo was released in March 2006, so I'm a bit confused by this line...

## Verse 2

This verse takes us into the late 90s.

Ravers in the sleeping hall
: many demoparties set aside a room where people can bring sleeping bags to sleep during the party instead of having to get a hotel. I assume that at some point a bunch of ravers came into the sleeping room and partied there, though I can't find when on a quick search; apparently this may have happened at The Party in 1995

Phong shaded metaballs
: [Phong shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading), invented in 1973, is one of the earliest shading techniques in computer graphics, and very easy to code. [Metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) are implicit surfaces created by finding the isosurfaces of 3D fields---you can mesh them to create triangles or render them with raymarching. These are both stereotypical things to see in early computer graphics. The video shows the 1995 demo [Dope](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=37), which boasts onscreen of how many Phong-shaded triangles it's displaying.

Contrast
: [an influential DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=72) from 1996

: [another significant DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1155)

The video shows [PSG-Wins](https://demozoo.org/productions/13592/) by Prestige.

Mekka and Symposium
: a [demoparty](https://demozoo.org/parties/series/62/) that ran from 1997-2002 in Saxony, Germany

Hyperventilation
: a [1998 DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=309) by the group Byterapers (hell of a name...), notably featuring samples from ABBA

paper aeroplanes
: the video shows a brief clip from [Paper](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=75), which was a classic 1996 64k demo; this apparently inspired people at the Wired party where it was released to [fold and throw paper planes](https://www.mediamolecule.com/blog/article/paper_alexs_64k_demo_from_1996) until someone got one in the eye

Poetry
: a [Windows demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1226) from 2000

303
: a [popular DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=44) from 1997

Dutchies and their colour schemes
: an injoke, referring to demos with tasteless, oversaturated colours, especially orange, red and yellow, associated stereotypically with Dutch sceners. [apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20170509163458/https://tomaes.32x.de/text/faq.php) this joke originates with someone called Macaw on the comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos usenet newsgroup.

Gravenreuth on the attack
: German lawyer Günter Freiherr von Gravenreuth [threatened lawsuits against](https://www.filfre.net/2016/01/a-pirates-life-for-me-part-2-the-scene/) many members of the warez scene, only to be eventually found to be involved in large-scale for-profit piracy himself

Secret Life of Mr Black
: a [DOS demo from 1997](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=86), apparently representative of the group 'Orange'

Sunflower
: a [succesful DOS demo from 1997](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=85)

Stash and Jizz
: two demos by demogroup The Black Lotus; [Jizz](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2) and [Stash](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3) were both released in 1997 (coincidentally some of the earliest demos to be recorded on Pouet, occupying IDs 2 and 3 in the database)

Blowing up the power grid
: according to scene legend, the power draw of hundreds of computers and CRT monitors at [The Party](https://www.theparty.dk/wiki/The_Party_1997) in 1997 burned through two 25,000 amp fuses and caused a blackout for a portion of the Danish town of [Aars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aars)

Enlight
: A ZX Spectrum [demoparty](https://demozoo.org/parties/series/80/) which ran from 1995 to 1997 in Russia. Became memetic after the final edition of the party was shut down and had the police called in for drinking and noise.

State of Mind
: A [popular DOS demo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=26) from 1998

real party is outside
: A meme referring to the outdoor gatherings during demoparties where sceners hang out, chat and drink---ironic since it doesn't really involve any of the main demoscene stuff (making demos and looking at them).

## Chorus 2

We Didn't Start The Färjan
It was always floating while the nerds were coding
We Didn't Start The Färjan
But we'll recreate it on a crusty 8-bit

Festivål
: during Assembly 2003, an unofficial music contest was held. The winner (by Jumalauta or tAAt) started with a quiet jaunty melody on a bottle orchestra, abruptly interrupted by someone yelling 'FESTIVAL!' and the rest of the group coming in on "whistles, drums and other football-crowd-style noisemakers." Yelling 'Festival!' rapidly caught on and became a running joke in the prizegiving ceremony.

Hallo... was?
: German for 'Hello... what'. Two samples from [a German meme video in which a confused woman talks to police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Kh82LQYzw), which became a meme after Sobec used to play the samples at a loud volume at parties such as Breakpoint 2005.
