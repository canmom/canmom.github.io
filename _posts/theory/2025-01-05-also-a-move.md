excerpt: The meaning of transitioning as a game we are collectively building (in which I accidentally do a Wittgenstein)
---
one of the people i most looked up to when i was first transing has, many years later, pretty hard disidentified with words like ‘trans woman’, 'transfem’ and so on. they still write to an audience of mostly dolls, but they’re doing some other gender thing now, and tend not to like being put in the trans woman/transfem box.

chewing on this and other things. fundamentally I don’t think gender is real. I have called it an egregore, and that still seems apt. and yet, words like 'trans’, 'autistic’ and so on are a pretty powerful correlate with the sort of person I tend to vibe with.

transing isn’t revealing some inner girl essence. the forces that produce a trans woman when enacted on the eager-to-reshape-itself human brain don’t necessarily <em>only</em> produce trannies: it is one of a number of moves available to you.

it is, however, a really big play in the game. given how ludicrously much gender infects every social interaction, going off-script in a big way is going to affect your psychology <em>hugely</em>. doing that activates the feedback loops, the self-exciting instability, a set of rituals let you <em>become</em> something more 'real’, or perhaps more precisely, something you have actively defined. the unpredictable outcome of that process is both the entire point and not the point at all.

rachel pollack <a href="/crit/unquenchable-fire">spoke of transing in terms of religious ecstasy</a>. <em>“I would argue that transsexuality arises from a passion so powerful that it transcends issues of happiness. The word passion originally meant suffering, not pleasure.”</em>

so having made a declaration like, <em>i am this sort of creature</em>, you break everything down and start to rebuild. you go on to take actions to affirm it, or even simply build an inner, secret core, and doing this - physically, socially - transforms the resonances of your thinking.

we have constructed many rituals to make the declaration of transness more definite. a lot of them will affect your sensory experience: the immediate effect of hrt on how your skin responds to touch is surely one of the great virtues. take surgery, for example - do you <em>need</em> to get your penis turned inside out? well: the drama of making a drastic alteration to your body, and the sheer difficulty of getting it, makes it an especially powerful ritual. but it’s not the only way to go. indeed, most girls I know haven’t done it (whether or not they want to), and instead, the symbol of woman-with-penis has become one of our core subculture-images. in the last few years, the word <em>faggot</em> has come back in a big way, with a real gendered connotation now, sorta like what the girls on here were trying to get at with <em>baeddel</em> before all the shit happened. that’s also a move.

so this phenomenon, this new game we’re building together, includes surgeries as a move. but it also includes a lot of the subculture-building classics: weird fashions, radical politics, drugs, kinky sex, making noises on the computer, and so on.

and since the whole point of this thing is a process of defining yourself into existence, as soon as something starts to become a cliché, an orthodoxy, a mandated practice, it starts to break down. everything is stupid fucking contextual. if everyone around you is desperately pursuing genital surgery, saying 'I like my dick and want to keep it’ becomes a potent move. but if the pendulum swings the other way, once everyone is saying 'do you really <em>need</em> surgery, you know you don’t need it to Be Trans, please stay as you are since it’s easier for us that way’, maybe that ritual regains some of its power. it’s perverse. perversity is kind of necessary to it.

so the meta evolves.

i am speaking about transness here, but i think similar forces are at work with other self-id games, autism and so on. there is like, actual biological variation, but far more important is the ideas we’re playing with on top of that. what concepts are activated when I think 'autism’, now largely positive associations: sensory this, obsession that; not the same as twenty years ago. thankfully my fellow autists made an interesting game to make of it: a space to express something.
