<h2>Our camera matrix</h2>

<p>As discussed at the end of the last one, the vertices of a model must be transformed by the model-view-perspective, or camera, matrix to place them in <em>clip space</em>.</p>

<p>What information do we need to generate the camera matrix?</p>
<ul>
  <li>the rotation of the model</li>

  <li>the displacement of the model from the origin</li>

  <li>the rotation of the camera</li>

  <li>the displacement of the camera from the origin</li>

  <li>parameters to define the perspective matrix, which with GLM, consist of:</li>

  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>the vertical field of view in radians</li>

      <li>the aspect ratio</li>

      <li>the distance to the near clipping plane</li>

      <li>the distance to the far clipping plane</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As it happens the example code for GLM involves calculating a camera matrix. So let’s have a look at how they do it.</p>

{% highlight cpp %}#include <glm/vec3.hpp> // glm::vec3
#include <glm/vec4.hpp> // glm::vec4
#include <glm/mat4x4.hpp> // glm::mat4
#include <glm/gtc/matrix_transform.hpp> // glm::translate, glm::rotate, glm::scale, glm::perspective

glm::mat4 camera(float Translate, glm::vec2 const & Rotate)
{
    glm::mat4 Projection = glm::perspective(glm::radians(45.0f), 4.0f / 3.0f, 0.1f, 100.f);
    glm::mat4 View = glm::translate(glm::mat4(1.0f), glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, -Translate));
    View = glm::rotate(View, Rotate.y, glm::vec3(-1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
    View = glm::rotate(View, Rotate.x, glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
    glm::mat4 Model = glm::scale(glm::mat4(1.0f), glm::vec3(0.5f));
    return Projection * View * Model;
}{% endhighlight %}

<p>This doesn’t allow an arbitrary camera direction, but rather requires that it’s pointed at the origin.</p>

<p>The function effectively takes three float parameters: the distance the camera is moved from the origin, and two angles to determine the direction from the origin.</p>

<p>First, it generates a perspective projection matrix with a 45 degree vertical FOV, a 4:3 aspect ratio, a near clipping plane at distance 0.1, and a far clipping plane at distance 100.</p>

<p>Then it generates a translation matrix to move everything in the -z direction by the amount Translate, equivalent to moving the camera by Translate in the +z direction. The openGL perspective projection matrix assumes the camera is pointing in the -z direction, which is exactly what we want. Note that the GLM functions don’t simply generate a matrix, but apply the translation to an existing matrix - in this case, the identity matrix.</p>

<p>Next, it rotates this matrix around the x axis, and then the y axis. Since this rotation is applied after the translation, this in effect moves the camera around the origin as well as changing which way it is pointing.</p>

<p>Finally, a model matrix is generated. In this example, it simply downscales the model to half the size.</p>

<p>For the return value, the three matrices are multiplied together in an order such that the model matrix is applied, then the view matrix, then the perspective projection matrix.</p>

<p>What about my rasteriser? To be fully general, I would need to rotate the model and camera arbitrarily, translate them in an arbitrary direction, and take arbitrary parameters for the perspective matrix. That’s probably overkill - we can write a more general algorithm later. Instead, let’s have the camera orbit the geometry at a fixed distance, and we’ll just use hardcoded numbers for the parameters. So all we need is the angle.</p>

<p>The function will follow basically the same lines as the example, but we don’t need a model matrix, nor am I going to rotate the camera around the y axis. For clarity, I’m initialising the view matrix as an identity matrix, and the compiler will handle optimising this.</p>

{% highlight cpp %}glm::mat4 camera_matrix(float angle) {
    glm::mat4 perspective = glm::perspective(glm::radians(45.0f),16.0f/9.0f,0.1f,3.f);
    glm::mat4 view(1.0f);
    view = glm::translate(view, glm::vec3(0.0f,0.0f,-1.5f));
    view = glm::rotate(view,angle,glm::vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
    return perspective * view;
}{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Let’s check it works</h2>

<p>I’ll add a simple function to print out the values of a mat4, so we can make sure we’re getting the kind of matrix we expect.</p>

<p>GLM matrices are indexed first by selecting a column, then a row, as in the OpenGL Shader Language. This is, confusingly, opposite the order we index matrices in mathematical writing. In other words, matrix[j][i] in code refers to matrix component \(M_ij\).</p>

<p>So a simple function to print a matrix to the standard output (I tried to do it to an arbitrary output stream but apparently passing cout as an ostream reference isn’t the right way to do it):</p>

{% highlight cpp %}void print_mat4(glm::mat4 matrix) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
            std::cout << matrix[j][i];
            if (j != 3) {
                std::cout << ",";
            }
        }
        std::cout << '\n';
    }
}{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then I inserted it in a bunch of points in the matrix calculation.</p>

{% highlight cpp %}glm::mat4 camera_matrix(float angle) {
    glm::mat4 perspective = glm::perspective(glm::radians(45.0f),16.0f/9.0f,0.1f,3.f);
    print_mat4(perspective);
    std::cout << '\n';

    glm::mat4 view(1.0f);
    view = glm::translate(view, glm::vec3(0.0f,0.0f,-1.5f));
    print_mat4(view);
    std::cout << '\n';

    view = glm::rotate(view,angle,glm::vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
    print_mat4(view);
    std::cout << '\n';

    return perspective * view;
}{% endhighlight %}

<p>Result for one radian rotation:</p>

<figure><pre>1.358,0,0,0
0,2.41421,0,0
0,0,-1.06897,-0.206897
0,0,-1,0

1,0,0,0
0,1,0,0
0,0,1,-1.5
0,0,0,1

0.540302,0,0.841471,0
0,1,0,0
-0.841471,0,0.540302,-1.5
0,0,0,1</pre></figure>

<p>The first of these is recognisably a perspective matrix - the last row being 0,0,-1,0 is a dead giveaway since that puts a vertex’s z coordinate into its w coordinate. The other parameters all look plausible.</p>

<p>The second is clearly a translation matrix, just as ordered. And the third is the product of a translation matrix with a rotation matrix. (I can’t tell if the matrix is correct for one radian of rotation just by looking, but it looks plausible). Perfect :)</p>

<p>For completeness, when we multiply those matrices together, we get this matrix:</p>

<figure><pre>0.733728,0,1.14271,0
0,2.41421,0,0
0.899503,0,-0.577564,1.39
0.841471,0,-0.540302,1.5</pre></figure>

<p>The next step is to transform the coordinates into clip space. This can be done by multiplying each point by the camera matrix.</p>

<p>(Though this isn’t really a lot of progress today, I got pretty distracted, and I kind of need to stop now. Tomorrow, though, I hope I can write the actual shading code.)</p>
