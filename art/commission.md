Things I'll draw include:

 - NSFW
 - guro (i.e., pictures involving gore, surreal or otherwise)---10% off!
 - fanart---I may need references if I don't know the character
 - original characters, such as RPG characters---please provide a detailed *visual* description
 - furries
 - trans characters---10% off!
 - F/F scenes
 - M/M scenes
 - kink content---make sure to specify exactly what you have in mind

I can draw in a more realistic style, or in a more anime style. I will do my best to achieve the style you want!

</details>

A gallery will be added to this site shortly, but for now you can see examples of my work on [Tumblr](https://canmom-art.tumblr.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/canmomArt).

If you would like one:

1. **message me** on Tumblr or Twitter or [by email](mailto:commission@canmom.art).
2. if I agree to do it, I’ll tell you **the price** and **when I can do it**.  if not, I’ll let you know asap.
3. if you agree that works for you, I’ll **send you an invoice** using Stripe.
4. once I get the money, **I’ll draw your picture**!
    * for best results, **give me _references_**: model sheets (for fanart and preexisting OCs), expressions, poses, drawing style, clothing, actors, general vibe...
    * ...but if you want to leave things up to me, that’s cool too!
    * let me know in advance if you want to **watch a stream** or **get a timelapse video**.
5. if you want changes, I’ll do **one round of small revisions for free**. if you want major redraws, we’ll negotiate a price.

Technical information
: I will generally speaking produce pictures as PNG images in the sRGB colour space. I can also provide the Krita project file. If you want to print a commission, I should work in a different, CMYK colour space, so let me know your requirements before I start!

Licensing
: By default, I will post the picture here and on Twitter **under a CC-BY-SA license**. That means, you and anyone else can repost it and make derivative works, as long as you release it under the same license and credit me. If you want a different license, we should discuss it before I start work.

Refusing commissions

: I will not draw NSFW involving kids, and NSFW/guro involving real people without their consent.

  Other than that, the main reason I am likely to refuse a commission is if I don’t have time. Likewise, if for some reason circumstances make it impossible to fulfil the commission, I’ll let you know as soon as possible and give you a refund.

Other things I might do
: Simple looping animations are possible - let me know if you’re interested and we can negotiate a price. I’m not offering more complicated animation at this time but I may in the future.
