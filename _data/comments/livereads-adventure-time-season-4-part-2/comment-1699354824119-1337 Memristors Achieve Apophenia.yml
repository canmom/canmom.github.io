  On the subject of under-eye war paint, while the trope in Western culture is
  associated with special forces, it's a bit wider than that.


  The reasoning is that cheekbones can somehow reflect a lot of sunlight into
  the eyes. Not sure why the hell we evolved to have cheekbones that can blind
  us, but painting the lower eye socket dark can:


  * Reduce the blinding effects of direct sunlight


  * Make a face less recognizable when camouflaged, as it modifies the shadow
  patterns our brains are trained to recognize as a "face".


  Here is attorney Woo Yung Woo wearing similar face paint for whale watching:
