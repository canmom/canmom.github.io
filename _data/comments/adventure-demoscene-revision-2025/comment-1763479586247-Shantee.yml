  Wow, that’s a very comprehensive summary of Revision 2025! I did not read
  everything but skimmed through it.  I was also hungry during the MBR event but
  damn I don't regret I delayed my diner it was really awesome and fun ;) I
  wonder what treat we'll have next year !

  Oh there's even a few lines about my (failed) demo ...This demo gave me lots
  of headache it was not made with "PlayEngine" as you wrote but "PlayCanvas" (i
  won't use it again next year ^^)  Otherwise yeah I agree it was not memorable
  and half of it did not work on the big screen :(
