  Maybe its the phrasing and you weren't actually confused and it's me reading
  your post wrong, but a slight potential misreading-Marias diary was written by
  Maria, but there was a single letter to Maria written by "Beatrice" in it, who
  is also the person who wrote the message bottles for what seems to be episode
  1 and 2.  The rest of her diary was written by her.
