  Driving by my old article and I realised I never replied to this comment!


  If I were to write this series again I would certainly recommend a crate which
  already has a robust implementation of 2, 3 and 4D vectors for graphics, such
  as `glam`, which is what I am currently using for my game
  <cite>Shaderland</cite>. (`cgmath` is another option, and has a cute approach
  of using the relevant algebraic structures to define its generic traits, but
  `glam` has a lot of useful functions which `cgmath` lacks and some nice
  efficient implementation details.)


  That said, I am glad I did this back in the day, since I learned a lot from
  learning how to write these kinds of traits!
