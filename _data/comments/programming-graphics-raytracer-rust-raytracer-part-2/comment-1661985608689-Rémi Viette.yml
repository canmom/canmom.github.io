  Hi!


  First, thanks a lot for these posts!

  It is so great to find someone crazy enought to want to do the exact same
  thing as me, but wanderfull anought to indicate all the traps to avoid.


  During my researchs, I found that the crate `num-traits` integrates a `Real`
  trait that seams to be the "parent" of every numberish's types in rust.


  So I just had to write `impl<T: Real> Vec3<T> { ... }` and return `T` when I
  mean a number.


  I'm not very experimented so maybe this behavior has some limitations. But it
  seams to be more concise than trying to englobe the entire list of numbers
  traits to work with them.
