  i so hope you continue this!! you have such a great ability to convey the
  nuanced parts in the story while making sure to include sourced references
  (whether within the series itself or otherwise) and explain a thorough,
  understandable map of the overarching storyline... major props to you
  honestly, you've helped me comprehend the series where not much else has
  helped and i've had a lot of fun hah

  take care! please think about revisiting this eventually ^^
