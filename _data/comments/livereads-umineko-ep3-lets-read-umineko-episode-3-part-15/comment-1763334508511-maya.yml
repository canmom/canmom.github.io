  I never read this as a tradwife thing more as "Hideyoshi is trying to convince
  Eva(-Beatrice) that her magic comes from making people happy and not
  *committing mass murder*", which is actually something that ties this scene an
  itty-bitty bit back to the EP3 prologue with Virgilia and the POV character
  likely at this point to have been Beato.


  Problem is, that just wasn't what Eva(-Beatrice) wanted or needed to hear.
  RIP.
