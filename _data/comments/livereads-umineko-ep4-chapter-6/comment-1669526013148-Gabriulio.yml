  One interesting tidbit is that The Witch Hunt translation team is not named
  after the in-universe group, it's the other way around.


  While the visual novel market has grown by leaps and bounds as years passed,
  it is still very niche nowadays, let alone back when Umineko first released.
  The few visual novels that had translations were, 99% of the time, those that
  had anime adaptations.


  The cycle went: visual novel gets released in Japan, but virtually no one in
  the English-speaking world hears or cares about it -> it becomes popular
  enough to gain an anime adaptation -> people in the English-speaking world
  watch the anime and think it's neat -> there's a very small but non-zero
  chance of a group of fans banding together to translate the source material ->
  there's an even smaller chance of the translation actually getting finished.


  Higurashi, Ryuukishi's previous work, fit all aspects of the cycle... but
  Umineko was different. Umineko wasn't unknown. Higurashi had an established
  fanbase thanks to its anime adaptation, so Umineko wasn't just "one of the
  thousand new visual novel released every year," it was "the next work of the
  Higurashi creator!". As such, there was interest in translating it even before
  EP1 first released, and a team of fans did just that.


  That translation team called themselves The Witch Hunt.


  The in-universe Witch Hunt organization isn't named like that due to
  coincidence, it was a deliberate homage to the translation team. Ryuukishi was
  well aware of the team's existence, and he was in fact honored that people
  were so interested in his work that they were translating it into an entirely
  different language. He even sent a letter to The Witch Hunt thanking them for
  their efforts, which can be found on their website.
