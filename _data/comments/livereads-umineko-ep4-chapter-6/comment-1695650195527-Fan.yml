  Actually, them being called Witch Hunters(in the original Japanese) is based
  on this translation team, which started working before ep4's release! If you
  know Rokkenjima.org, their podcast for episode 8 has a member of the group on
  to talk about this! I wouldn't recommend the website before finishing it
  yourself though, or at least making a more finalized theory then I've seen.
