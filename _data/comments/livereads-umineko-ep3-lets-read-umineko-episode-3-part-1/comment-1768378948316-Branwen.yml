  Regarding future Bryn's comments: I find these meta scenes (this one and the
  one with him interrupting the previous tea party) specifically with Battler
  being uncomfortably sexual absolutely fascinating in the way they contrast
  Battler's dual positions as an undeniably powerless victim and a young, rich
  man who holds tremendous implicit social power over the women in his life. 


  Like he is powerless to the point that escape even through death is
  unimaginable, objectified in a sense far more literal than its often used. But
  rather than this leading him to empathize with, frankly literally *any* of the
  women or servants in his family and the power dynamics they've spent their
  lives subjected to, he doubles down on his socially implicit male role as the
  objectifier, as the person who gets to feel powerful, in control, perhaps even
  funny and charming! Certain I knew plenty of teenagers back in the day,
  especially boys, who were undeniably popular and considered funny for making
  uncomfortable transgressive "jokes" about women, children, poc, etc. And I
  think its probably true that victims by and large don't become better people
  for suffering. Personal growth is hard, and its only made harder by feeling
  vulnerable and afraid. Most people just lash out and double down in that
  situation, Battler included.


  That's also fwiw a framing I really like for Battler's behavior around his
  cousins. He hasn't seen them in a third of his life! Its so easy to imagine
  him feeling insecure, out of place, vulnerable from his fear of planes and
  boats, unsure of his position in the social hierarchy of a deeply hierarchal
  family. So what does he do? He acts up, he makes himself the center of
  attention. Maybe's done that in class a dozen times, acting the rebellious
  class clown who made his peers laugh with inappropriate jokes, the kid who was
  a little too rich and not quite disruptive enough for the teachers to ever do
  more than tell him off. He hits his baby cousin when she says things he thinks
  are wrong, because he's the adult now and that's what her mom does, isn't it?
  He needs to show he's mature now, after six years. He doesn't hit her hard, he
  doesn't want to hurt her, its just a little reprimand, he's just trying to
  teach her better behavior so she doesn't get bullied. He doesn't even realize
  that his actions are just as potentially hurtful and damaging to Maria as
  Rosa's were when he was the only one to rightfully call her out in game one.


  It's such a compelling characterization to me bcuz not only does it make him a
  really nuanced protagonist, someone who cares deeply about his family despite
  their flaws, who feels strongly enough even as a child to renounce his family
  name and cut off his own father over a perceived abandonment of his dead
  mother! But it also paints a really believable picture of the way the shitty
  little things about patriarchy and abusive power dynamics continue to
  propagate. The microaggressions, the ways smart, empathetic men who it seems
  like should know better will often double down and get defensive when their
  behavior is challenged, the way people who explicitly reject the power
  dynamics of their parents can still recreate them in subtler ways, an example
  of how victims can and do become abusers in their own rights even without
  realizing it.


  Not to mention that like. It's honestly really relatable! I've personally felt
  the urge many times to lash out with words when I feel powerless to try and
  assert that I have some say in things still. I used to make nasty,
  self-effacing jokes when I felt insecure or out of place, for reasons that
  feel much the same as I imagine Battler's to be, and I have friends who still
  haven't broken that habit. I still struggle with feeling like an "adult"
  around my parents sometimes, despite the fact that I first moved out over a
  decade ago, in no small part due to financial dynamics and having had a really
  rocky relationship with them growing up. I'm sure pretty much anyone with
  friends around my age (especially trans friends!) has heard similar things. 


  I think it can be tremendously effective writing for exactly that reason. If
  (or perhaps when!) one can look past the shock value and the discomfort with
  Battler's behavior to ask "Why might someone act like that?", they're placed
  in the perfect position to recognize that the small (but difficult!) step
  they've taken towards kindness and greater cognitive empathy is exactly the
  same skill that Battler is struggling to master. And its a skill that can do
  so, so much good in the world.
