  This is such a fantastic comment! Really good analysis of what's going on with
  Battler, and with Umineko in general---it's so much a story about learning to
  understand the Other, the 'why would someone do that'.


  With the benefit of a few more years' hindsight, I feel like I can understand
  both the version of me who wrote this part of the liveblog originally, and the
  version who wrote the 'notes from the future', with sympathy to both. It's
  kind of funny, really. Both 'Bryns' were trying very hard to play up to some
  ideal, not unlike what you say about Battler. When I edited in all these notes
  I was feeling this strange sense of shame about what I saw as my overly
  moralistic younger self, but now it's evident how much at that point I was
  *also* trying to perform like 'I'm cool now, I'm into edgy guro stuff' to some
  other imagined judgemental viewer. Kind of cute in a way.
