  As someone whose main experience of this story has been through the manga,
  it's interesting to see the choices Ryukishi07 made when given the chance to
  retell this story in a different media, I never realized the order of
  presentation of events was so different between the manga and visual novel. In
  the manga adaptation of Alliance of the Golden Witch (which I'm taking some
  time to reread lol) all of the things regarding Ange and her whole Deal and
  her relationship with Maria are frontloaded, and it's only after the basic
  stakes outside the game-world are established (as u will learn when you read
  more) that we then get into Ange's past in the direct aftermath of the
  Rokkenjima incident, and then after that, only around the end of volume 2 of
  the manga (out of 5) does the story on the game board begin to be woven in
