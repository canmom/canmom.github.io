comment: "I was reading through this and a few sections ago you asked if there are explicit gay couples, so I'd just like to mention that there are actually! \n\nThere's one that's just straight-up lesbian and another that involves a character whose gender identity is not explicitly explained but the relationship is very clearly not straight regardless. \n\nThere are also several extremely popular interpretations for other characters/pairings that have a strong basis in canon subtext even if they aren't ever more than alluded to/hinted at; I rather suspect you'll arrive at most of those on your own as you keep reading, based on your interpretations so far\U0001F601"
