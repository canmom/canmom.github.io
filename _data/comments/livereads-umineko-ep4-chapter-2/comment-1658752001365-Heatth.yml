  Finally caught up back to this liveblog! I loved reading it back in the day,
  but continuing things I once stopped is always hard for me for some reason, so
  I just decided to read all again from the start. It is very amusing seeing
  your future notes here and there.


  I am really enjoying seeing your theories about magic and witches evolve over
  the course of these episodes. "Magic is real, yet is fake as shit" mirrors my
  own thoughts back then, so I am looking forward seeing how this thoughts will
  evolve.
