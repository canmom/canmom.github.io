  Umineko has become one of my all-time favorite narratives and I LOVE
  watching/reading people go through it because everyone approaches with a
  different perspective. 


  One person might hit on the core of one thing super early but be wildly off
  about something else until much later, and another might do the exact reverse,
  or find a completely different path of thought that brings them to their own
  answers. 


  Without getting too spoilery, Land was changed to Banquet because Ryuukishi07
  felt like he wasn't getting his ideas across to the audience in the way he
  wanted. 


  It's the sort of thing where if you already know the story in its entirety
  Legend and Turn are actually giving you a lot, but if you're going in cold
  you're not going to process it in the same way and Ryuukishi07 misjudged the
  distance between those two perspectives. 


  Rokkenjima Prime is, in fact, the name the fandom settled on for timeline
  containing the 'real' (if such a thing exists) events of Rokkenjima on
  10/4-10/5 1986. (Not a spoiler, as the name was used as the EPs were still
  coming out and people were theorizing about...well pretty much everything.)
