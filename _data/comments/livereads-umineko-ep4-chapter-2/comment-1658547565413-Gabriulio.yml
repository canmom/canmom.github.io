  Funnily enough, there is an actual Japanese clothing brand called Auntie Rosa,
  which Umineko's is parodying. It's another example of anachronism, since the
  real life Auntie Rosa was founded in 1998.


  The name of the real-life company is written as アンティローザ, while the Umineko
  version is written as アンチローザ.
