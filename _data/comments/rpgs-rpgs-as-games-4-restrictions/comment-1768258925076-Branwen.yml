  Hullo, I've been really enjoying reading this series! It brought to my mind a
  few things with respect to writing novels as games, bcuz I think its actually
  a super interesting lens (if not necessarily the best one lol).


  For background, me and some of my friends post works on royalroad.com and
  similar websites. You may be familiar with the site based on some of your
  other post I've read? But the two things that feel very relevant are.


  1. The vast, vast majority of works on the site fall into what I would call
  "genre fiction", and,


  2. The site has very explicit ranking systems based on readership and ratings.


  In practice, this means that there's absolutely very strong unwritten rules
  about what is, and isn't, acceptable in the form and content of any given
  fiction based on the genre(s) it falls into. Violating these unwritten rules
  will result in fairly immediate negative comments, bad ratings, and negative
  reviews, so while unwritten an experienced author (or even reader) can
  definitely understand them pretty well. I know that Suits himself later
  changed his view on "judged sports" to say that they were performance, and
  separate from games, but even under that paradigm (that I don't personally
  know if I even agree with!) I think the fact that these rules are entirely
  unwritten potentially works in the "writing as game" theory's favor here. The
  situation has a much stronger aspect of incomplete information when trying to
  understand the aesthetic preferences of readers vs, say, figure skating
  judges. And writers can try to cultivate a readership with specific tastes by
  writing a story, synopsis, or title, and even choosing cover art that signal
  certain things about their work and its genre, in essence acting within the
  rules of the game to alter the criteria they're being judged under and the
  people they're being judged by.


  Plus point 2 blurs the lines even further. The algorithmic rankings of works
  includes entirely non-aesthetic considerations like post frequency and
  regularity, and authors can and do make structural changes to their work, e.g.
  shorter, more frequent chapter posts, to account for this. The site has other
  gamified aspects, like various achievements for both writers and readers, and
  indeed works are almost exclusively serialized and often include quests or
  stories with a high degree of reader interaction, both of which are points you
  already mentioned. 


  So like. To my mind then, the question is if thinking about writing in the
  context of sites like royalroad as a game actually useful? It seems like
  potentially yes? For authors, they can frame part of the their process as a
  game to try and create a receptive audience for the kind of work they want to
  write, and shape their work in response to their understanding of the rules
  and expectations imposed by that audience. It seems pretty reasonable to
  imagine that this could result in not just a more creatively authentic work,
  but a much more joyful experience for both the author and their readers. And
  the site admins could potentially use ideas from game design when
  creating/tweaking their algorithms, categorizations and tagging systems, and
  so on. 


  Just my 2 cents as someone who fundamentally agrees that calling a novel a
  game is probably an overextension of the idea :) I'm sure there are other
  concepts in sociology or literary criticism that could capture some or all of
  these dynamics just as well too, but it doesn't mean that it's not a super
  fascinating framework for analysis of some of the structures at play when
  writing many places online these days.
