  I think you missed one way to do it, used in "this war of mine" (and to a much
  lesser extent "a dark room")


  You can absolutely blitz your way through the game killing hundreds of people,
  and the game will reward you (somewhat) for it.


  The game will not try to humanize the people you kill beyond a few hints.


  But you likely won't kill these people. Or at least, I didn't.


  A few tricks are used. These people are usually not soldiers. They live in
  houses like yours. They act scared and actually try to save themselves most of
  the time.


  But the main trick is to present the enemy exactly like you present the
  characters you control, except that you don't control them. Their only cringe
  is to not be beholden to your cursor.


  So the role playing mechanisms that you allowed to work on your imagination
  are all there in full force. With an added frustration of "what won't you let
  me help you".


  But there's also another type of enemy, the soldier, the sniper, the raider,
  the man with a weapon and the intent to kill. And at first you see them as
  puzzles, and kill then without too much ethical troubles.


  But some of your characters are not as strong and clear-minded, and now you
  see them chain smoking and shaking locked up in their room, and you empathize
  with their guilt.


  You can build humanity in the enemy, even if the enemy was on screen for a
  couple bloody seconds.
