  I'm in the midst of catching up with this liveblog and just wanted to put my
  hat in the ring and say I'd love to see you try to tackle silent hill f some
  day if you ever end up feeling compelled to go through with that! I've been
  incredibly curious about what the game would be like since news came out that
  ryukishi would be writing it, but I've got a migraine condition that means
  playing the game myself or even watching footage of it is completely off the
  table. getting to see someone as thoughtful as you liveblog it would probably
  be the best secondhand experience possible.


  I've really enjoyed this umineko liveblog and have had a lot of fun dipping my
  toes into your side tangents about game design and ttrpgs more specifically.
  not really a space I've ever been personally involved with myself so getting
  to see something I do have firsthand familiarity with it through a lens I
  wasn't really capable of applying myself is definitely giving me a fuller
  picture of the work. that's the nice thing about works that are as much of a
  behemoth as this one I suppose! you can't ever run out of new ways to look at
  them
