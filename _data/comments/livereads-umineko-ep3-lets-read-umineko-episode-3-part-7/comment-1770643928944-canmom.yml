  Hi! Comments on the old stuff are welcome, but I do appreciate the recognition
  that it's old haha.


  I appreciate this angle because I think I was kind of taking the opposite
  perspective: that George is an idealised love interest for Sayo: he's rich,
  upstanding (supposedly...), generous, and of course willing to defy his family
  to be with her. He feels almost like a romance novel guy. But you're
  absolutely right, Sayo is equally the archetype of the shy, clumsy moe girl
  (and literally a maid!).


  I don't think I really get into 'author!Beatrice' interpretations until a fair
  bit later in this liveblog, but I definitely came to suspect by the end of
  Episode 4 that neither of these characters is 'real', and they might instead
  be composite characters of some sort...
