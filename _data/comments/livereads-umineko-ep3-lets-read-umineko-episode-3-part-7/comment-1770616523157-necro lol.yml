  I don't know if it's polite to leave comments on old shit like this but I'm
  reading this liveblog because I just finished Disc 1 and I wanted to see
  someone else's perspective. I just wanted to interject some thoughts I had re:
  shannon in this scene because there weren't any future notes on it.


  To me, Shannon's aggressive gendered performance of heterosexuality is meant
  to emphasize the exaggerated narrative tropes at play. As 'less real' and
  'less human' members of the cast, the servants embody narrative tropes much
  more strongly than the family members. Shannon is the overly maiden-like
  'ideal female love interest' type of servant, where Kanon is more of a 'ideal
  male love interest'. They're sort of tailored to be 'of use' to jessica and
  george in the wider narrative by being their stock romance options.
