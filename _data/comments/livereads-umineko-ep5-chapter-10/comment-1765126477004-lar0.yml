  I *did* watch Paripi Komei, every thursday. 


  While reading I had a thought that the beginning of the chapter, with Erika
  pointing the finger at Natsuhi and then going "how did we get here", is kind
  of mirroring more modern police procedurals where we see the crime being
  commited, and it's less of a full "who/howdunnit" and more of a "how is the
  detective going to catch them".
