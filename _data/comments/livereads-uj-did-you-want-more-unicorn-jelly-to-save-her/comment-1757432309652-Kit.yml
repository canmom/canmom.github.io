  "“A cascade event”, huh? I wonder what alternate-universe-heavy story has had
  that idea?"


  JDR was referencing a short story called Cascade Point by Timothy Zahn, which
  "contains fictionalized mathematical analysis of higher-order dimensions of
  space/time" per one review.  It won a Hugo award back in the early 80's - it's
  a really good read, and tbh I recommend basically everything Timothy Zahn ever
  wrote if you're into sci-fi.  I assume Homestuck was referencing the same
  short story, but I've never actually read Homestuck so I can't say for sure. 
  Cascade Point is set in the far future where humans have gotten around the
  speed of light limitation by developing technology that lets them 'rotate'
  through alternate universes, and thereby skip across large swaths of spacetime
  and then return to their own universe at a distant point.  During a cascade
  event, the people traveling are subjected to visions of themselves as they
  would be in alternate universes, which can be.... psychologically troubling.


  FWIW, she confirmed the reference back on the forums when TSH was being
  written; this was actually my Timonthy Zahn gateway drug, lol.
