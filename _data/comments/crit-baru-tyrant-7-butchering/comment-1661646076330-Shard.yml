  Isnt the point of Barhu's plan precisely that Falcrest's involvement in it is
  non-existent from the start? Its weird, because it suddenly seems to disappear
  when she finally explains it to the Brain, but isnt the entire point to use
  Falcrest's wealth to create a trade route that would then facilitate commonly
  beneficial trade between the Mbo and the Stavky, bypassing Falcrest altogethet
  thanks to the never before possible route through the Imnarin and Voltjag?


  In this setup, which is what she explains when figuring things out with her
  headmate, Baru seems to have a plan to trick Falcrest into thinking they're
  doing their usual extractionist capitalist form of trade, when in reality
  she'd be setting up the rest of the Ashen Sea to cooperate to cut Falcrest out
  of world trade.


  This is weird though, because that's clearly her plan, and many other plots
  revolve around the northern side of that set up, but then when she talks to
  the Brain, and afterwards, its like they've forgotten that the trade is
  supposed to skip Falcrest altogether, almost like she's hiding the full plan
  from The Brain and pretending to be reducing the whole thing to "Im taking
  over Falcresti trade" instead, when the real plan should be much easier to
  "sell" to the Brain.


  The real plan of course seems to rely a lot on "hopefully people will do good
  if given the chance, and creating this trade route allows for material wealth
  to move between the Mbo and Stackiavhi Necessity, and once Falcrest has been
  removed, hopefully people will thrive because there aren't other Empires
  around". The vibe I got through the book at first was that Baru had understood
  that a good world is made by cooperation between people, by people being good
  to each other, and that a single person scheming couldnt create that world, so
  she needed to, instead, focus on creating the conditions that would make such
  a world possible, knowing that after that, it's on the rest of the world to
  cooperate; so she comes up with the best conditions she can think of: a trade
  route that connects vastly different places and would allow everyone involved
  to thrive, because trade does not have to be a zero sum game.
