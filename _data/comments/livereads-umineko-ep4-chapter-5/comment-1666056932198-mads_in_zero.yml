  Just caught up with this live-read today! Absolutely loving the theory
  crafting. Finally, Episode 4 introduces the best character, Sakutaro, the
  powerful diplomatic vegata-lion, who I guess essentially has had Beatrice's
  legal theme stapled onto Maria's idea of him.


  I do love stories that equate creating something through magical means to
  essentially creating a character.
