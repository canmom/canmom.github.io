  Oh right! There was something I wanted to say, now that I've caught up - I
  really love that this visual novel signals magic by using electronic music.


  Episode 1, which is a major paschtiche of certain styles of detective fiction,
  (closed circle rich mansion, characters dropping one by one), maintains a
  consistant classical music flair throughout, they have so many violin pieces.


  Until, suddenly, Maria reads out Beatrice's letter, and the first really
  off-kilter song (Fishy Aroma) plays. It's the first song a lot of players,
  myself included, really notice as standing out.


  And then, when the murders start, we get the music playing over the body
  discovery, GoldenSlaughterer. It mixes Beatrice's classical music leitmotif
  with Electronic Dance Music to create a song that signals the classical
  mystery tropes have been interrupted by a Witch.


  (There's another series of doujin VNs that use electronic music for a similar
  effect (signalling "magic"), the TYPE MOON series, particularly it's second
  entry, Fate/Stay Night. Ryukishi is unabashedly a fan of those games.)
