  Hello 'no.'


  You can believe what you will. Sadly it's not possible to maintain total
  information isolation over eight+ years of writing this project, but I've done
  my best to both not 'cheat' and to disclose where I've seen something I
  shouldn't if it's relevant.


  I believe the spoilers I've received are relatively minor, although it is
  frustrating to have been spoiled in a mystery story. In the interests of full
  disclosure, here's what I accidentally learned and how:


  <details markdown="1">

  <summary>Did you know you can use HTML in comments?</summary>


  - I know the story will ultimately revolve around some sort of writer
  character. Unfortunately, I saw a Tumblr post about this character and didn't
  realise what I was reading was Umineko-related until about halfway. I've
  applied more stringent blocking since then.

  - I know Kinzo grew up in Taiwan. I saw this in a wiki infobox, while looking
  up something else (I think probably the kanji for his name or something like
  that). After this I've avoided looking at the Umineko wiki.

  - At some point, I looked on the Wikipedia page for Umineko to get release
  dates, and while scanning the page, I vaguely recall glimpsing that there are
  different culprits in each episode. I'm not even 100% I am not confabulating
  that, though. I don't know who the culprits are.


  </details>


  Although each of these is a fairy small piece of information on its own, it is
  possible to infer a lot from it in relation to the rest of the text. However,
  I promise I'm not reading ahead: I write this liveblog as I read the chapter.


  I believe Umineko is more than a rich enough story to provide interesting
  things to talk about aside from the 'can I figure out the mystery' aspect, so
  I am continuing the liveblogging project. Up to you whether it's worth
  reading.
