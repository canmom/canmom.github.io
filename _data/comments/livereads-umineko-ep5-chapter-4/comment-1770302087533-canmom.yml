  As to whether my thoughts and theories are 'mine alone': I don't think this is
  really true of anyone, right? I mean even just within this head, the version
  of me that started this project in 2017 and the version of me that is working
  on it now have ended up diverging in more than a few ways, so I consider it
  something of a collaboration between these two different Bryns. (compare: Eva
  and Eva Beatrice?)


  Like, this is a strange problem to me: from day 1 I've been talking about this
  blog with readers, at least some of whom know the ending. Everyone has been
  really scrupulous about not telling me anything, which I appreciate. But even
  someone saying something like 'you'll be kicking yourself when you see the
  real solution' is a piece of information: it tells me I haven't got the real
  solution and to look again. With enough of that sort of feedback I'd Clever
  Hans my way to the right answer. So I'm afraid, if for you the standard of
  'ideal liveblog' is that I'd be locked in a dungeon, only able to write
  letters out until I finish episode 8, that just isn't what this project is.
  There's a lot of fun in trying to guess, but also I hope in commentary,
  analysis and discussion.
