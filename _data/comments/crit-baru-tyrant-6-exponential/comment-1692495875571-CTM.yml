  I like this take on Kimbune's formula as part of the story; while this choice
  of formula is indeed a little annoying... especially as it is written
  exp(I*Pi)+1=0; it would be more elegant to write "Pi I"as is usually done,
  than "(I*Pi)"; 


  But more to the point, Kimbune gives then goes on to give the *wrong
  definition of Pi*, saying it is "the ratio of a circle's radius to its
  circumference" (!), adding to the impression that this is an incompetent
  flourish of material the author does not himself understand... 


  Too bad Kimbune didn't write down the Lefschetz trace formula, or even the
  Leibniz formula pi/4 = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+ ..., either would have been less
  forced...
