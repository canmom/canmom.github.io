  i love this dialogue so so much. for attention-deficit reasons i often find
  myself skimming the denser sections of your non-fiction writing but the
  dialogue captured me. the exploratory game taking on shape and mass and doing
  unexpected and productive things - it IS like role-playing games, isn't it?


  the head space or inner world stuff is super interesting to me. my partner has
  an incredibly elaborate IW for her hundreds of parts, and i think that's been
  true for years and years. before i knew i was at all plural i set myself the
  task of trying to build out an IW to whatever extent i could, because it
  seemed cool - and that has been helpful for establishing what little contact
  i've managed with my most mysterious alter (that i know about). but all my
  partner's alters apparently do their own thing in the background while not
  fronting (i have questions about how you could possibly have that much running
  on brain hardware at once! but i think we know very little about how we run on
  brain hardware at all, and myself even less.)


  anyway yeah IW visualization has been useful for me - pre-plural exercises
  (demon summoning, tulpamancy) have been useful - an analogy i like is tarot,
  right? like a tarot deck is just however many pieces of cardboard; it doesn't
  know anything. but the human mind is deep and murky and we don't know a lot
  about what's going on down there, so we use symbols and pageantry to probe the
  depths and see what surfaces. like psychotherapy, also. plurality is a tool
  for conceptualizing the self/ves, and if it produces results you find useful,
  then it doesn't matter whether you're "really" plural or not.


  also i feel like everyone of a certain age&experience has some part of them
  that is dave strider. this is normal, do not panic.


  anyway yeah loved this piece, & thank you for writing & sharing it!
