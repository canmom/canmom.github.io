  I got linked this page on a discord server and spent my afternoon binging
  through it. I really liked it. Seeing people's thoughts as they're introduced
  to something I like is one of my favorite things, and this scratched that itch
  so well.


  EGS means a lot to me, I guess I am one of the "trans girls that grew up
  reading stuff like this" you mentioned in one of the early posts. It's part of
  what showed that being trans was something that was even... possible... and
  it's where I got my name from.


  Anyways, it's been six years since you caught up and a lot has happened,
  honestly some of my favorite moments in this comic. A lot of stuff that has
  been built up for so long was resolved during Sister 3, like the deal with
  Magus, Pandora, Susan and Diane... and even another party with more
  transformation hijinks!


  Sister 3 was pretty long, lasting two IRL years, and after that we got another
  arc, The New World, and we're currently a good ways into another arc called
  Balance, both focusing on the fallout of Sister 3 (and also Sam's date with
  Sarah is in there, and it's really cool and talks about trans stuff a lot).


  This blog doesn't seem to be very active anymore, though your main one is, but
  if you'd be at all interested, I would love for you to go back to this comic
  and read through what's happened since you caught up.
