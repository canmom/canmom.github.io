  I didn't realize there was a comments section until I found this comment :O


  I really appreciate this commentary, even if it's not current. I found EGS
  from a Tumblr poll tournament of trans webcomic characters, then got hooked on
  a couple new trans focused web comics I didn't know about. I binged the
  ENTIRETY of EGS in a few days (and lost a lot of sleep and productivity which
  I am still reeling from) and I don't think I really properly digested the
  whole thing. It's hard to, as difficult as the earlier panels are.


  It was at least clear from the outset (and the vague expectation that Ellen as
  a character existed thanks to the tumblr poll) that this seemed set up as a
  thinly veiled outlet for gender things for Dan Shive but even more thinly
  veiled transformation fetish (except self-proclaimed PG-13 which is still
  maintained to this day, somehow (and since they're literally going to college
  soon and all of the fetish and other stuff persists Dan is gonna have to
  reckon with that fact one way or another))


  I digress, this was pretty helpful for me to digest a lot of the themes I
  never stopped to think about. I can put many restless thoughts to... rest.
  Except I'm still obsessed about Tedd. Some of the newer stuff gets WEIRD. But
  oddly enough this comic has maintained my interest. I hope it continues to get
  better.
