  coming here to say i loved this review and also your baru reviews, which i
  consumed at a potentially worrying speed. you feel very similar to how i do
  about dickinson's writing-- though your observations are much sharper! i'd
  love to read more book reviews in this vein, and also hear any book
  suggestions you might have! cheers
