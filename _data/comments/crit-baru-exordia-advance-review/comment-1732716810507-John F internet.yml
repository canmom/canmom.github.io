  "There is a phone call scene towards the end of the book that is just brutally
  tragic and simultaneously so goddamn funny, I think I was in a superposition"


  This is a great description. I think part of what made the characters feel so
  whole to me was the comedic bits. People will make light, silly jokes,
  innuendos bordering on being non sequitors, in all kinds of situations.
