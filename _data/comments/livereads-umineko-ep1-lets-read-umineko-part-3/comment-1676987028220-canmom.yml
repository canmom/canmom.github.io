  Hello, 'z'. I doubt you're interested in a sincere answer but I feel like it's
  worth giving one all the same.


  I don't find it worthwhile to pantomime outrage about fictional things
  anymore. There's enough real shit to be upset about, and fiction is a handle
  we can use to examine it, but that's impossible to do more than superficially
  if we treat every story as a morality play.


  So I don't need fictional characters to be moral and in fact it's often more
  interesting if they aren't. Battler is (as we'll see) a very endearing
  character, but he's still fucked up by his place in society. Rather than turn
  up my nose and rant about how I could possibly be asked to sympathise with a
  figure like that, I would rather observe the function of this scene in the
  narrative, the elements that go into its construction, fantasies it may be
  fulfilling etc. etc.


  On that note, I don't think I did that fully above, so let me expand further.


  Here, it creates a contrast between a sort of 'haha isn't it so silly'
  portrayal of sexual assault (conventionally, the 'perv' character tries to
  grope someone's boobs, she pulls out a hammer and smacks him), and a more
  grounded portrayal of the power dynamics involved (understood all too clearly
  by poor Shannon here). It's not the first time Umineko will do something both
  playful and critical towards genre conventions. In this first readthrough, I
  couldn't detect that the discomfort in this scene is blatantly 'intentional'.
  So rather than be angry with the novel for minimising sexual assault, my
  reaction on the second read through was 'oh oof, well played ryuukishi07'.


  We'll learn more about Battler's characterisation over the course of the
  novel. He's playing a role as much as any of the Ushiromiyas. Battler naively
  wants everyone to get along, and he's only sensitive to power dynamics in the
  most obvious cases. Part of the whole thrust of <cite>Umineko</cite> is that
  the world can't be cleanly divided into 'good' and 'bad' people, but instead
  to portray the dynamics and situations that give rise to cruelty.


  This is also an early illustration of how the same interaction can read very
  differently to different characters - the multiple 'truths' we'll read about
  later. To Battler, he's playing the role of a comic relief character in
  fiction to relieve tension. To Shannon, someone connected to her employer is
  demanding a sex act and she feels she has to oblige. Obviously Shannon's view
  of the situation is the more insightful one here. But the story gives us both
  for a complete view.


  So there's a lot going on here. I didn't want to just leave it as "how dare
  you portray this ryuukishi". Battler does grow out of his whole 'look at me
  I'm such a perv' persona, but this is also far from the nastiest thing we'll
  see in <cite>Umineko</cite>, nor the last time we'll be asked to understand
  (though not absolve) a character who's committing violence. If it's a line,
  best stop here.
