  Hello. First of all, congratulations on your return and also for finishing
  EP3! I discovered your liveread last year, and was eagerly waiting for the day
  it would be continued. Your commentary on the story is always incredibly
  fascinating to read.


  To answer your question regarding "Rokkenjimagate," the original Japanese name
  for it is 六軒島大量殺人事件. From what little research I could find, Japan tends to
  use 事件 in a similar fashion to -gate, so the localization feels appropriate to
  me, despite it not being the only use of 事件.


  One last thing I'd like to comment on EP3, which kinda borders on meta trivia,
  is how the original plan for the Episode ended up being completely different
  from the version we got. Long story short, Ryukishi07 has admitted to lurking
  on message boards between Episode releases to gauge the fans' reception to his
  work and adjust things accordingly.


  The original plan was for EP3 to be called "Land of the Golden Witch" and it
  was already halfway written when he realized that the fans were not engaging
  with the story in the way he intended, so he scrapped Land and wrote Banquet
  from scratch. When this was first announced, many people were worried that he
  wasn't going to finish things in time for that year's Comiket. Thankfully he
  pulled through, but I can only imagine how bad that crunch must have been.
