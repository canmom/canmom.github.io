  I never knew Fall, but I saw a link to this site on your post for TDOR. After
  reading this, I truly felt like I knew her, and I’m heartbroken to learn one
  of my sisters was lost. This is a beautiful way to honor her. Thank you for
  sharing and keeping this posted. May we remember her not just on TDOR, but
  every day, and carry her spirit with us in all our actions. We lost you too
  soon, Fall, and while we didn’t know each other, I will carry you with me.
