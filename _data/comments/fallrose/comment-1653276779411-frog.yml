  i miss my friend.


  i regret not talking more, but i don't want to talk about regrets. i don't
  even know what i want to talk about. talking to her about certain things,
  magical and insane things, she was one of the few people i've ever spoken to
  who didn't make me feel like what i was saying was crazy and made-up. she made
  me happy. knowing she was out there, in the times we didn't talk, made me
  happy.


  i have known thousands of people. even people i like, even people i love, tend
  to blend together in my recollection. fall is the only one of her i've ever
  met, and the only one i ever will.
