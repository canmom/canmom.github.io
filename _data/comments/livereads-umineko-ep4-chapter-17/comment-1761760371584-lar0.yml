  We are so back.


  I always loved the english dialogue Beato has through the phone in this
  chapter. I'm sure many of us who learnt English as a second language as
  children have a memory of repeating"I'm fine, thank you, and you". No clue
  what the author meant by putting it in a scene like that but it is fun.
