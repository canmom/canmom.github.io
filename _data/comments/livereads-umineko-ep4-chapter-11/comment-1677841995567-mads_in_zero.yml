  You might recall that Gaap gets a brief mention all the way back in Episode 1,
  where Maria insists that no locked room is impossible for Beatrice, since her
  demon friend Gaap can travel instantaniously and freely.


  As an aside, we must imagine a modern day Umineko where Maria insists sussy
  Beatrice vented into the garden shed.
