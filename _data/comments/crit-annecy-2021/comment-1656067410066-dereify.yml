  Something you might have missed due to only having an online ticket:


  At the start of nearly every movie, before the lights turn off, students
  compete to send paper planes from the rafters to the screen. If any paper
  plane touches the screen, the whole cinema erupts, it's quite fun.


  When the light turns off, students will make a bubble popping sound for some
  reason.


  If the starting animation has a rabbit, the students will scream "lapin" very
  loud.


  It's all good fun
