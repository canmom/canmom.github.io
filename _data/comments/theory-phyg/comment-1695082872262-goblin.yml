comment: "honestly, its such a fucking shame seeing people take advantage of the vulnerable in this manner.\r\nive seen far too many friends of my own - genuinely fragile people, marginalized and socially reclused in diferent, unique and altogether very generally endangering ways - get dragged into some weird shit backwards ass fucking prison camp denying \"racial cleansing\" sympatizing cult-esque subcultures, and just losing these people because theyre a bit \"too deep in\"; even after warning after warning after 6 hour long debate abouts fucking 'viability of a large scope transition to a maoism-based society in europe'- just goes to show the systemic targeting of stuff of the sort (eg right wing internet extremism and the general archetype of an 'incel') and this is a really helpful summary that may be a catalyst for someone one day break out and cut off from a cult! hell, even just to help single out a movement or something of sorts.\r\n\r\ntl;dr ty for making this, might really help some poor shmuck someday"
