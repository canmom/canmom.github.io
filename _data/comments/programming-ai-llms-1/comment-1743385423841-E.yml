  So excited to see more of this series - I have liked and found uses for genAI
  like chatgpt and deepseek but am frequently a little frustrated seeing the
  gulf between what I can get and what a more experienced prompter with a
  fine-tuned model can come up with. Looking into it on my own seemed
  intimidating, but this is a super accessible read, with tons of helpful key
  terms and helpful links if I want to follow anything in specific. Really
  excited to see where this goes and hoping it gives me the push to start
  playing around with this more soon!!
