# Pocket Healer

## ONE

The floor's soaked, puddled everywhere with blood. It always is.

Half of Tank is at my feet. Her hips and legs are perhaps four metres away. Her intenstines spool out across the floor, winding between the craters, full of hungry ghosts that will happily eat her body as much as her last meal.

She'll be fine.

My hand is cramping from the effort. The intenstines start to rise, fluids slicking off them, a ripple here where there's almost a rupture. Four metres away, my love's legs twitch, and rise up on my invisible strings. There is a memory in this flesh. Knows how it ought to be. Just needs the fuel to get home.

A slip. Three years ago I would have gleefully stamped on the red ribbon I'm now clutching so desperately. I'd have rubbed her half digested shit in her dead invader's face.

The intestines drop half a metre, skimming over the muck.

I bite into the side of my cheek, taste blood. The intestines keep moving. Coil up at the base of her ribcage. Her legs slide up to meet them, heels spreading ripples through the clotting blood.

I can't look up. Whatever the Enemy is doing, I just have to hope the others will keep it busy.

A soldier stumbles across the space that Tank's intestines had just been floating. Something catches him; his pretty face becomes fragments of bone and tiny white threads of destabilised matter.

Thank you for this blessing!

I reach out to the fresh, hot life inside him. His chest craters, his blood hangs in the air before flying towards Tank. She is lucky. Her body will accept all types.

Tank's skin knits together, and the threads connecting me to the inside are breaking. But all seemed to be well. I crouch on top of her, push my ear up to her mouth, waiting for the wet, hot breath that will confirm I've done my duty.

There...

Her arms wrap around me, and the tension releases from my shoulders. She pushes herself up and nibbles my ear a bit. Then, I am gently displaced. She's whole again---not so much her armour, and the hasty reconstruction shows a thick new scar wrapping around her now-bare waist.

The other members of the fireteam have not fared well while Tank was broken. Most of them are impaled on long white spears: their own skeletons turned against them by a mote of command. Several have broken and run, but this granted them no mercy, and now they slump from running poses---transformed into eternal monuments to their cowardice.

But some rallied, and kept the Enemy busy, just long enough. An old woman with buzzed hair and a missing eye is directing them: form ranks behind a dead horse and firing precise volleys.

The horse by this point looks like a garden of red, sticky flowers. But with each new growth, it becomes more effective cover. Until the Enemy moves to a better position, and all these soldiers die at once.

But now? My Tank's turn. Oh, look at her go.

Tank has stepped forward. Between the soldiers and the Enemy, ignoring the bullets whipping just over her head. The Enemy's blind face pays her no heed... but then she raises her insectoid abdomen, clumsily sutured to her hips, and screams. Her pheromone gland starts to spray, colourless, undetectable to me.

But to the Enemy... this stench must overwhelm even the gunpowder. It abandons its advance on the soldiers. It surgest towards Tank, a wheel of white lance-legs.

And I can't help but call on my Art to peer inside. Just where I expected the human---a nameless boy, barely an adult, his ribcage split open to admit new alien organs. But it's his face I want to see...

I find it. It's no longer filled with zeal or bloodlust, but an insect's lascivious glee at having found the perfect mate.

The pheromones are working.

I get ready.

Tank closes her eyes, spreads her arms. Maximising target area.

The Enemy collides with her, hectocotylus needles slamming through her body in search of eggs that do not exist. Blood sprays over the soldiers and their horse. And I command Tank's body to maintain its integrity. The needles forget their nature. They become part of Tank, tiny little tentacles that rapidly atrophy and fall away leaving only skin, bruised but unbroken.

The Enemy, most of its limbs shattered, its footing lost, is now in position. Tank is back up, placing her boot on it, prybar seeking the right hole--- calling on her abilities to find the human. She crunches the prybar home.

Her muscles contract, firing without heed of the damage they might cause to her own arm. Because I'm there, putting them back together. It's something of a specialty.

The Enemy's carapace splinters, some kind of white goo seeping from within. A large plate comes away in Tank's hands. I see the face of the human, still recognisable for the meaty tubes puncturing the skin. His expression is so hard to read. Relief? Even bliss?

Tank looses her revolver, takes aim, and fires all six rounds into the boy's face.

She leaps away, and walks back to me, reloading with practiced motion. Killing the boy's brain has rendered the Enemy mindless, its limbs flailing, but it's still dangerous. The soldiers emerge, six in total, and line up to fire. Over and over.

At last, the cave is silent.

I lay a hand on Tank's shoulder. She's shaking. Barely holding it together.

The one eyed woman approaches us. Her soldiers slump onto the floor, faces a perfect flush of awe, apprehension and grief. But not this one. She's seen it all before. The red dress of a Healer proves nothing to her.

She points to one of the impaled soldiers. Somehow, he's still alive. Squirming a little.

"Can you do anything for him?"

What a question.

"Of course."

She stands, watching me. I don't move.

"Well?"

"Well what?"

"Will you heal him? He's not got long."

I blink slowly. There is blood in my eyelashes.

"No."

Tank starts to walk away. I turn on my heel, and walk with her, starting my checkup. We need to get her inside, but I can make a few fixes here and there.

Somewhere behind me, the impaled soldier lets out his last ragged breath. The one-eyed woman is radiating fury.

Well, let her report me.

## TWO

Tank is crying. This is unfortunate. I don't like when she cries.

I briefly wonder about going into her brain to try and crush the memory. Probably wouldn't work. Maybe practice on someone else first?

Instead, I sit down on the bed next to her, and reach an arm around. She doesn't flinch anymore when I touch her. Perhaps she knows me by smell.

I reach inside and command her lungs to slow down. Stop the hypervenetilation first. Ah, blood sugar seems kind of low. There is an apple on the table nearby, still with enough life inside it to disintegrate it and infiltrate the sugars through her skin.

I rub the essence into her shoulders, and turns her head to nuzzle into me, a strand of tears and snot running down to the corner of her mouth and then drip off her chin. But she seems to be stabilising. I find a tissue and wipe away the mess. That's a bit better.

"How many more times?" she whispers.

I don't answer.

A native orderly appears at the entrance to the room. Quietly, they place a a crisply folded new uniform on the shelf. They glance at me, and their eyes narrow. Out the room in a hurry, no doubt swallowing some cutting remark.

My people do not like me much more than the soldiers.

Tank sniffs. Perhaps I can do more for her. I climb onto her knees. She likes to touch me---likes to find the places where my body is soft, when hers has to be so hard.

It suits me. I don't mind her touching me.

She holds my wrist in her rough hands. So gentle. People don't imagine that Tank is gentle, when they see her tearing the Enemies apart. It is one of the things that only I know about Tank, just like the weight of her lungs on her diaphragm, and the expression she made when she killed my family.

Tank's hands make their way down and unbutton my breeches. Opening me up, like the Enemy, but for a different reason.

I fish out the bottle from my kit. Semen has many uses in alchemy. Usually I collect it in private, but it's a comfort when Tank wants to help me out. I squirm, in the way I know she likes. "That's right, Tank."

## THREE

The one-eyed soldier reported me. Apparently she is very senior. I don't really know the rank insignia.

"We have cause to doubt your loyalty. You will undergo surgery."

I nod. If the Leader says I will undergo surgery, then I will undergo surgery.

They will poke around in my brain, and when they're finished, I will still be loyal. To Tank.

## FOUR

Another expedition.

The cave we cleared has given us access to a long, narrow tunnel that the natives have drilled. (My people are very ingenious and familiar with the inside things. It's all the same Art.)

Of course, it is full of traps: cutting filaments, explosives, grinders and fire. It would take months to disarm them all, by which time the rebels at the other end would have evacuated.

So they'll send Tank.

Tank is shaking.

"I don't want to do it again."

I button up her uniform, and tighten the straps around her waist. I was able to remove most of the scar tissue, so she does not flinch.

"It's all right. There's nothing they can do to you which I can't fix..."

It's the wrong thing to say. She twists around and grabs my wrists. Her collar is still undone. My fingers twitch towards the discrepancy.

"So let them kill me! Or do it yourself! I've given enough."

This is awkward.

The silence stretches out.

Tank releases me, and slumps. I hold off doing up her collar. It's a delicate moment.

"Can't they send... a pig? Something that isn't human?"

She knows why.

I won't heal a pig.

## FIVE

We are halfway along the tunnel. Tank has so far lost three arms and four legs, and one time been bisected by a rotating saw, which was an interesting challenge.

I stay about two metres behind Tank. Close enough to work my Art, but far enough to not get caught in the blast when she steps on a mine and the shockwave liquifies her innards through the blast carapace.

My people could simply have placed landmines, and kept it simple. But we are Artists. The rebels' traps are a contest of sadistic ingenuity---better to challenge the healers. No doubt I have something of a reputation.

Then again, it might have no design at all. I have heard the Enemy's alchemists have isolated the nature of such devices in an alchemical ritual, and need only cast the spores in the tunnel as they make their escape.

The tunnel slopes down, and branches frequently. Each of us has a bright lamp, but the gloom soon swallows the beam.

It's barely wide enough for one human to crawl. We can't turn---to leave, we would have to crawl backwards the full length of the tunnel. Awkward for me, and crushing for Tank. (Earlier, I amputated her insect abdomen to better navigate the tunnel. She watched me place it in the freezer with a distant stare.)

By this point, she is of course almost naked. I cannot heal her uniform as well as I can heal her flesh. I like that I get the chance to watch her ass as she squeezes along the tunnel.

In between the traps, it is very quiet.

When the soldiers came to my town, they were heralded by a wave of refugees. The Capital had fallen, we were told. The invaders possessed flying castles which released alchemical bombs, bombs which destabilised the essence of buildings so that they would transform into pure geometric forms. What remained of the occupants would dribble out through cracks in the new structure.

I wanted to see this, so I remained in my town.

My mother refused to abandon me, so she volunteered to join the partisans. My brother joined her. We knew we could not defend the city. The garrison was meagre. In that time, we were armed with alchemical rods from the old empire, which could once transform entire formations into gnarled, waxy clumps, all replete with limbs and faces. But the enemy soldiers wore armour imbued with a fierce will to dominate, which negated the rods' destabilising effects. We might as well have just had metal sticks.

The enemy did not deign to send their flying castles. They conquered us the old-fashioned way: by finding us in our hiding places and shooting us. We had not yet found tactics appropriate to this new enemy. In the end, we must have bought less than a week.

Tank found the three of us in an old cellar. She was alone. Very young. About the age of my brother and I.

The first thing she did on entering the room was shoot my mother. The bullet entered her abdomen, bounced off her ribcage, passed through most of her intestines, and came to rest in the hip. With my current skills, I could certainly have repaired it. But in that time, all I could do was stop her heart.

My brother charged with a knife. She knocked it aside, twisted the blade from his grip, and threw him down at my feet.

"I find myself," Tank said to us, in our own language, "tired of sex with my subordinates. Would either of you like to drop your panties for a pretty young soldier? I'm not picky..." The statement had an awkard cadence: evidently she had rehearsed it.

"Never!" my brother said. "You can kill us, you can burn our lands, but you'll never take---"

I reached out with my nascent Art and clumsily snapped his cartoid artery. It was easy: he was my twin, so we shared the same flesh. He collapsed in seconds, gurgling. Better to spare him this.

"I want to live." I said.

Her brows furrowed in curiosity.

"What happened to him?"

I explained.

She seemed a little disturbed by how easily I had killed my own flesh and blood. This was odd, for a rapist. I asked her why.

"Aren't you an interesting one." she said, which was my only answer. Then she fucked me. I tried to be as compliant as possible, which she seemed to like. Afterwards, she did not shoot me, like I still somewhat expected, but took me back to her camp.

I am drawn back to the present by the tunnel giving way, revealing two large drums covered in interlocking teeth. Tank has fallen partway down, clinging to the walls of the tunnel to try not to fall in further. Her legs are just stumps, ending above the knee. The drums are coated with gore. Some of it flew back as far as me. I think anyone else would have quickly been swallowed up into the grinder. But not my Tank.

Still, the situation is unfortunate: the lower legs are not in a state I can easily recover. I pull the rest of her backwards, away from the grinder, and seal the wounds before she loses more blood.

I will have to make her some new legs. This might be easy or difficult, depending on my materials. The further its nature from human legs, the more work it will take to purge the memory of its old form and train it in anew. A tree root pierces the tunnel, and I consider it. But no: better to regrow directly from the stumps. She has enough excess fat and muscle to make it viable.

I will have to be close. I crawl up behind her and place my hand on her thigh. She shivers. I've negated most of her pain, but she's still reeling from the shock. I don't like seeing her in such a state, but there is a fascination. The body can bear so much, with a little help.

I start to make my rearrangements, growing the familiar forms outside the shattered stumps, stitching nerves and weaving muscles. Her thighs get thinner.

It's OK. I'll be able to flesh her out again later.
