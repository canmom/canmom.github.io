Two months into your apprenticeship, the Master bound demons into your shoulders. They erupted in immense boils, which the master methodically lanced; you screamed into a strip of leather, shuddering against the ropes holding you to your chair.

The demons were small, and each one was placed in a bottle and taken somewhere out of sight. Their inhuman keening, not vocal cords but tendons, were almost as pitiful as your own whimpers. These were demons of arm flesh, and they had no eyes to see by; the flesh was not potent, and their lives would be short even without the Master's experiments.

He spoke seldom during the procedure, but after the last of the demons was safely bottled, he scratched through the summoning-circle he had engraved on your skin, and softly dabbed away the blood and tears, and told you you had done well.

You never found out what became of the demons. That night you cried softly in your cold cell, and then a strange urge took you and you masturbated onto the sheets, and for want of a way to hide the seed---so precious and potent in magic---that the Master might not take this as well, you swallowed it. This became a nightly ritual.

Five months into your apprenticeship, your master found you wearing a dress you had stolen, your face carefully made up using ritual inks. You weren't even doing anything, just sitting in it, tense and shaking, but convinced you were alone with your terrible secret. What you are doing is the darkest blasphemy of the order, the act that could destroy all hope of you ever becoming a wizard.

So naturally he just walked in.

He said nothing the entire time. He took the dress, of course. And he went to the knife rack, and came back with a large cleaver, polished---like all tools in the house---by a homunculus which tottered after him, leering up at the knife, tiny hands holding a sponge almost the same size as its head. He placed a chopping board, and grabbed you by the back of the head, and you felt your body go completely limp as he stretched out your arm and slammed the cleaver down, severing it in one stroke. Blood sprayed across the room, but then you felt a heavy pressure as he leaned his full weight on it, staunching the bleeding for now.

Still not speaking, he jammed a finger into the bleeding stump of your arm, and drew a small magic circle. Another stroke of the cleaver removed a finger from your already-dead arm; he dropped this into the circle, and held his hand over it, and it rippled and grew into a small sac. With the subtlest of motions, your Master peeled it open and revealed the tiny, curled body inside. This he raised to his lips, and whispered commands you could not hear; and then he touched it to your open vein, and pushed the arm back where it had been, and miraculously the blood vessels and tendons were knitting together... encasing forever the demon born from your finger.

Your Master took your wrist, and carefully raised your arm, nodded once at his handiwork. He passed you the dress again, and gestured to the blood; sensing his meaning, you set to mopping up, though the stains would remain on the flagstones.

"We will never speak of this." he announced, and then swept out of the room, the ruined, blood-soaked dress over his arm.

That night, when it came to do your 'ritual', your arm would not cooperate. You could imagine the demon inside, forbidding sinful acts. All your rebellions would now have to come from your left hand only.

These were the worst days, but there were many more that were simply bad. The Master's rituals were exacting. Err in the placement of a rune, and he would strike you, sharply, with a wooden rod. One strike, but enough to send you sprawling, wheezing and weeping. The old man was impossibly strong.

Then, of course, were the offerings. Demons take root in flesh, and for the lesser demons such as you were permitted to see, common farm animals would suffice. Cats were common---the Master had made it known that, should a litter face the drowning-sack, he would pay well to see them to his workshop instead. No doubt there were families whose livelihood came from supplying the Master his cats. At first you would lie awake, recalling their plaintive voices as the demons took root under fur, but eventually you became numb to such things. So, too, the squeal of dying pigs, the fearful gasps of lambs.

One time the Master even bade you implant demons in a horse. The beast was untamable, they said, and when you approached it kicked you hard enough to shatter a leg. The Master tutted, and uncorked a lesser demon to repair you, and another to stupefy the horse; you held it steady as the Master worked his way around, carving the words of power into its flanks. So tamed by magic, it whickered and nuzzled you, utterly ignorant of its impending death.

The demon the Master called granted it legs by the dozen, and split its head down the middle, and worst of all it spoke clearly, whispering praises from the ruined face of the horse. Each night for weeks after you lay soaked in sweat, and would come to the day's rigours grey-faced and stupid, flinching at the slightest movement.

So it went for three years of your life.

Not all of the Master's sacrifices, of course, were mere animals. The most potent demons could only be summoned in a human host, and occasionally you would oversee a scrawny, hungry-faced mother or father appear at the threshold of the tower, a sobbing infant tugging at the hem of their cloak. The Master would seize the infant by the wrist, and draw out a jingling sack of coin that seemed to him just a trifle; the parent would hurry back into the darkness, not looking back at their shame.

On many of those nights, storms lashed the tower, as if God wanted to punish the Master for his blackguardery.

You did not see what became of the children; such rituals were too dangerous to be entrusted to a mere 'prentice. But now and then you would see a face on one of the homunculi that seemed a little familiar.

Of the Master's ultimate design... well, that remained unfathomable. As the years wore on, you saw him less and less, and he would be quicker to strike you or upbraid you. You had always flinched at his coming, but now the dread filled your lungs like a second demon, snatching away your breath. Yet some days, he would emerge from the workshop with a softer mood... he would look upon you with a sad smile, and lavish praise on your progress in the Arts.

No divination could pierce his moods. You would sometimes lie wondering if your true parents would treat you thus, and find that you could scarce remember their faces.

You did not stop wearing dresses---but now, it was easier to trace his movements, so you were never again caught. To stop it giving you away, you would seize the false arm and bind it to your hip.

One summer, a troupe of travelling players came to the Master's tower, seeing a wizard's tower as a suitably grand backdrop for their tale of sin and debauchery. The Master glanced at the commotion only once, and scoffed at it---but upon seeing that you could not tear your gaze away from the window, he smiled as if recalling something. "Go, then." he said. "It is natural to be drawn by pretty girls at the fair."

You didn't tell him it wasn't the girls you were looking at.

You dressed in your best approximation of what the peasants wore. Your woolen cloak showed no sign of fraying, and surely it would mark you as a rich man's son to those who looked close, but it should at least draw little attention. Summer or not, the morning was cool, with a stiff breeze from the distant sea, and your breath fogged the air.

The players were all men and boys, as was the custom in those times. The tale they spun told of an orphaned girl who went to the city to seek a husband, only to suffer depredations at the hands of cruel merchants and foreign sailors. But she remained virtuous, and caught the eye of a nobleman's son out to campaign who saw at once her Christian virtue. They were betrothed, but he was called to battle, and an arrow pierced his heart the day they were to be married. So struck was she with grief, she flung herself off the cliff top to be with her love... but as a suicide, she went to Hell and remained separated from him for eternity.

It was a beautiful performance and you cried a lot.

Of course, the actor playing the girl caught your eye. You couldn't stop your eyes following his little earing, the corner of his jaw catching the morning light (he had some kind of glitter on, you belatedly realised, to make the skin shine better), the way his lips moved softly around the syllables, the gleam of his eyelashes. And there he was, wearing a dress in broad daylight, walking like a woman, and people were cheering him on!

Lucky bastard.

Whether it was lust (sinful) or jealousy (also sinful), you tarried after the performance ended to see if you might find this strange brazen boy. You even, it must be admitted, entertained dreams of running away to join the theatre, but you knew better to trifle with your Master's designs.

You found the players a short walk from the wagon, most of them stripped to the waist or further as they put away their costumes. You found yourself blushing and turning your gaze down, even though as a man among men, it should cause no-one discomfort to gaze where you will.

The Fates must have been smiling that day, because the one actor you hoped to meet indeed caught you standing there. "Ho, there!" he cried. "The wizard's apprentice, if I am not mistaken?"

You felt your cheeks getting warm, despite the chill. With some effort, you open your mouth to answer. "Just so, my friend! Alas, for I had thought myself a little more inconspicuous."

The actor laughed. "Oh, it is not what you're wearing, young master wizard. It is---" and you looked up to find that he'd walked right over to you, and taken you by the elbow, arresting you with those beautiful eyes "---the haunted look, of one who has seen far too many things that should never be seen. As an actor, I'm trained to see such things, you see." He blinked, ever so slowly.

You didn't feel cold anymore. You did feel a lot of things, things hard to name, but cold was not one of them. You were probably biting your lip.

"Then... have you met a lot of wizards, on your travels?" you managed. "I am shamed to admit I know only my own Master, and no other luminaries of the Art."

He laughed. You wished to fall into that laugh and wander it forever, like the legendary Bull of Minos. (In that moment, it scarce mattered that the bull was slain.)

"Why yes indeed!" said he. "My companions and I have wandered among all manner of wizards, sorcerors, sooth-sayers, mystics and chirurgeons. Most, alas, have shown little interest in the theatre. Perhaps when one is accustomed to the dances of angels, the orations of men seem knavish to compare."

You spluttered a protest. "To say such things, when you alone would shame the highest seraphim!" You had not yet seen an angel, but you could not fathom them being half as beautiful as this actor boy. Nor as well-spoken.

Looking back, it was scarcely a surprise that he should have kissed you. But you had not such wit, back then. Still, you had enough sense to kiss him back; his lips were surprisingly soft (not that you had much to compare them to), and you held there as the kiss stole your breath and sent shivers out to your fingers.

"Well!" said he, when you finally pulled apart. "For certain, you are not like other wizards." For some reason this made you far more proud than any praise your Master had bestowed.

You found yourself babbling. "The Master says that magic is a man's power. The power of the penis, which is the most sacred flesh. Defile yourself as a man, like the ancient eunuchs, and the demons will laugh in your face, for they know you belong to them already." These were forbidden secrets, but you would tell anything to this boy. In any case, he just nodded, as if this was no news to him.

"Such seems to be the belief among wizards." But not, you realised, you. He raised an eyebrow, letting you figure it out.

"I think..." you said. "I think I don't agree with that belief very much."

"Is that so?" He smiles and tilts his head and you would like to kiss him again, very badly.

"I think the demons probably don't care half so much as my Master does. And I am coming to feel my Master is not the most reliable teacher." As it should turn out, only one of those statements was true. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Your lovely actor nodded. "Well, you are wiser than most wizards then." he says. "But suppose I am not convinced of all these airy theories..."

A terrible spirit took you then---one which would set your fate. "Are you proposing..." you said, as coyly as you could manage, "that we put them to the test?"
