Two months into your apprenticeship, the Master bound demons into your shoulders. They erupted in immense boils, which the master methodically lanced; you screamed into a strip of leather, shuddering against the ropes holding you to your chair.

The demons were small, and each one was placed in a bottle and taken somewhere out of sight. Their inhuman keening, not vocal cords but tendons, were almost as pitiful as your own whimpers. These were demons of arm flesh, and they had no eyes to see by; the flesh was not potent, and their lives would be short even without the Master's experiments.

He spoke seldom during the procedure, but after the last of the demons was safely bottled, he scratched through the summoning-circle he had engraved on your skin, and softly dabbed away the blood and tears, and told you you had done well.

You never found out what became of the demons. That night you cried softly in your cold cell, and then a strange urge took you and you masturbated onto the sheets, and for want of a way to hide the seed---so precious and potent in magic---that the Master might not take this as well, you swallowed it. This became a nightly ritual.

Five months into your apprenticeship, your master found you wearing a dress you had stolen, your face carefully made up using ritual inks. You weren't even doing anything, just sitting in it, tense and shaking, but convinced you were alone with your terrible secret. What you are doing is the darkest blasphemy of the order, the act that could destroy all hope of you ever becoming a wizard.

So naturally he just walked in.

He said nothing the entire time. He took the dress, of course. And he went to the knife rack, and came back with a large cleaver, polished---like all tools in the house---by a homunculus which tottered after him, leering up at the knife, tiny hands holding a sponge almost the same size as its head. He placed a chopping board, and grabbed you by the back of the head, and you felt your body go completely limp as he stretched out your arm and slammed the cleaver down, severing it in one stroke. Blood sprayed across the room, but then you felt a heavy pressure as he leaned his full weight on it, staunching the bleeding for now.

Still not speaking, he jammed a finger into the bleeding stump of your arm, and drew a small magic circle. Another stroke of the cleaver removed a finger from your already-dead arm; he dropped this into the circle, and held his hand over it, and it rippled and grew into a small sac. With the subtlest of motions, your Master peeled it open and revealed the tiny, curled body inside. This he raised to his lips, and whispered commands you could not hear; and then he touched it to your open vein, and pushed the arm back where it had been, and miraculously the blood vessels and tendons were knitting together... encasing forever the demon born from your finger.

Your Master took your wrist, and carefully raised your arm, nodded once at his handiwork. He passed you the dress again, and gestured to the blood; sensing his meaning, you set to mopping up, though the stains would remain on the flagstones.

"We will never speak of this." he announced, and then swept out of the room, the ruined, blood-soaked dress over his arm.

That night, when it came to do your 'ritual', your arm would not cooperate. You could imagine the demon inside, forbidding sinful acts. All your rebellions would now have to come from your left hand only.

These were the worst days, but there were many more that were simply bad. The Master's rituals were exacting. Err in the placement of a rune, and he would strike you, sharply, with a wooden rod. One strike, but enough to send you sprawling, wheezing and weeping. The old man was impossibly strong.

Then, of course, were the offerings. Demons take root in flesh, and for the lesser demons such as you were permitted to see, common farm animals would suffice. Cats were common---the Master had made it known that, should a litter face the drowning-sack, he would pay well to see them to his workshop instead. No doubt there were families whose livelihood came from supplying the Master his cats. At first you would lie awake, recalling their plaintive voices as the demons took root under fur, but eventually you became numb to such things. So, too, the squeal of dying pigs, the fearful gasps of lambs.

One time the Master even bade you implant demons in a horse. The beast was untamable, they said, and when you approached it kicked you hard enough to shatter a leg. The Master tutted, and uncorked a lesser demon to repair you, and another to stupefy the horse; you held it steady as the Master worked his way around, carving the words of power into its flanks. So tamed by magic, it whickered and nuzzled you, utterly ignorant of its impending death.

The demon the Master called led it to grow legs by the dozen, and split its head down the middle, and each night for weeks after you lay soaked in sweat, and would come to the day's rigours grey-faced and stupid, flinching at the slightest movement.

So it went for three years of your life.
